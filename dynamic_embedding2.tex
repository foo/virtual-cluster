Model will be a modification of model from previous chapter. The only
difference is that each VM can process arbitrary amount of chunks
instead of only one.

Our approach will be tree binarization, followed by dynamic
programming algorithm. This time, instead of just having one array
with costs, now we have 3 arrays, named cost[T, x], up[T, x] and
down[T, x]. Array cost[T, x] is the
same as previously, the sum of bandwidth allocated in subtree T,
knowing that it contains x VMs. Array up[T, x] is amount of transfer
from chunks that did not fit inside tree T because of capacity
constraints and have to be pointed outside. Array down[T, x] is amount
of processing power of the subtree; in other words it is the amount of
transfer that can be pointed towards VMs in T. Both up[T,x] and
down[T,x] are closely related to cost[T,x] in the sense that we assume
that the same decisions about placing VMs were taken in up, down as in
cost.
