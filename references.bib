  abstract = {Network virtualization is an important concept to overcome
    the ossification of today's Internet as if facilitates innovation
    also in the network core and as it promises a more efficient
    use of the given resources and infrastructure. Virtual networks
    (VNets) provide an abstraction of the physical network: multiple
    VNets may cohabit the same physical network, but can be based on
    completely different protocol stacks (also beyond IP). One of the
    main challenges in network virtualization is the efficient admission
    control and embedding of VNets. The demand for virtual networks
    (e.g., for a video conference) can be hard to predict, and once the
    request is accepted, the specification / QoS guarantees must be
    ensured throughout the VNets lifetime. This requires an admission
    control algorithm which only selects high-benefit VNets in times
    of scarce resources, and an embedding algorithm which realizes the
    VNet in such a way that the likelihood that future requests can be
    embedded as well is maximized.
    This paper describes a generic algorithm for the online VNet
    embedding problem which does not rely on any knowledge of the
    future VNet requests but whose performance is competitive to an
    optimal offline algorithm that has complete knowledge of the request
    sequence in advance: the so-called competitive ratio is, loosely
    speaking, logarithmic in the sum of the resources. Our algorithm
    is generic in the sense that it supports multiple traffic models,
    multiple routing models, and even allows for nonuniform benefits
    and durations of VNet requests. Concretely, the routing models
    considered in this paper include: multipaths, single paths, and tree
    routing. For modeling traffic, we study the customer-pipe model, the
    hose model, and a new traffic model, called {\it aggregate ingress
    model}, that is well suited for modeling multicasts and multi-party
    video conferences.},

  abstract = {Network virtualization is an important concept to overcome
    the ossification of today's Internet as if facilitates innovation
    also in the network core and as it promises a more efficient
    use of the given resources and infrastructure. Virtual networks
    (VNets) provide an abstraction of the physical network: multiple
    VNets may cohabit the same physical network, but can be based on
    completely different protocol stacks (also beyond IP). One of the
    main challenges in network virtualization is the efficient admission
    control and embedding of VNets. The demand for virtual networks
    (e.g., for a video conference) can be hard to predict, and once the
    request is accepted, the specification / QoS guarantees must be
    ensured throughout the VNets lifetime. This requires an admission
    control algorithm which only selects high-benefit VNets in times
    of scarce resources, and an embedding algorithm which realizes the
    VNet in such a way that the likelihood that future requests can be
    embedded as well is maximized.
    This paper describes a generic algorithm for the online VNet
    embedding problem which does not rely on any knowledge of the
    future VNet requests but whose performance is competitive to an
    optimal offline algorithm that has complete knowledge of the request
    sequence in advance: the so-called competitive ratio is, loosely
    speaking, logarithmic in the sum of the resources. Our algorithm
    is generic in the sense that it supports multiple traffic models,
    multiple routing models, and even allows for nonuniform benefits
    and durations of VNet requests. Concretely, the routing models
    considered in this paper include: multipaths, single paths, and tree
    routing. For modeling traffic, we study the customer-pipe model, the
    hose model, and a new traffic model, called {\it aggregate ingress
    model}, that is well suited for modeling multicasts and multi-party
    video conferences.},
