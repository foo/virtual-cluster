\title{A Note on Virtual Cluster Embedding with Data Locality}

\title{Exploiting Embedding and Replica Selection Flexibilities for Optimal Virtual Cluster Allocation}

\begin{abstract}
By decoupling applications from the constraints of the underlying physical
infrastructure, virtualization introduces interesting new opportunities 
for an optimized resource allocation. In this paper, we distinguish between two
fundamental dimensions of a more flexible resource allocation in virtualized
environments: flexible virtual node placement ($\FP$) and replica selection ($\RS$). 
We study the underlying individual and joint optimization problems, 
also taking into account the impact of virtual network communication costs ($\CC$) as well as 
bandwidth constraints $\BW$.

This paper shows that both the $\FP$ and the $\RS$ problem variants can be optimally solved in polynomial time,
and we present a dynamic programming and a max-flow algorithms (for $\FP$) and a matching algorithm (for $\RS$) accordingly. 
However, we also show that jointly optimizing the two dimensions is computationally hard, by presenting an NP-hardness proof. 

We believe that our paper can provide the networking community with important insights into the 
design of algorithms to exploit resource allocation flexibilities in virtual environments, as well as the fundamental (computational)
limitations of such optimizations.

\section{Introduction}

Server virtualization has revamped the server business over the last years,
and has radically changed the way we think about resource allocation in the Internet today.
Indeed, the success of cloud computing relies to a large extent on virtualization:
the possibility to allocate virtual machines flexibly and on-demand.

The virtualization trend now started to spill over to the network. Indeed, it is well-known
that provisioning virtual machines is often not sufficient to guarantee a predictable performance
to cloud applications, as the interference in the underlying network can significantly delay the
execution.~\cite{talk-about} This is particularly the case in batch-processing jobs such as MapReduce, which consume
a considerable amount of bandwidth resources during their execution.~\cite{amazonbw}

A most prominent virtual network abstraction is the \emph{Virtual Cluster} $\VC(n,b)$:  
the virtual cluster provides the abstraction of $n$ virtual machines connected to a logical
switch at (at least) bandwidth $b$ (essentially a Hose model).~\cite{oktopus} 
In other words, the virtual cluster provides isolation guarantees over both resources, 
the computation (the virtual machines) and bandwidth (the network). 

The problem of how to efficiently and jointly map the nodes and links of a virtual cluster in a given datacenter is non-trivial,
and has been studied for several years now.~\cite{oktopus,proteus,secondnet} The problem is complicated further when taking into account
\emph{data locality issues}: usually the inputs to a cloud application (the so-called \emph{chunks}) 
are stored in a 
distributed database in the datacenter, \emph{in a redundant manner}. The virtual machine mapping algorithm should take into account 
the locations
of the problem inputs (the chunks and their replicas), in order to avoid unnecessary transmissions over the network.

In this paper, we are interested in the fundamental algorithmic problems raised by virtualized datacenters,
where virtual machines can be placed flexibly and input data is stored redundantly: 
How to exploit the flexibility of mapping virtual machines and their interconnecting
network flexibly, in order to minimize the resource footprint of the application while providing
the requested resources (and hence performance guarantees)? 
And how to take into account data locality and exploit
redundancy in the distributedly stored problem input (replica selection)?  

\subsection{Model}

We distinguish between two fundamental new optimization problems introduced by virtualization: 
The decoupling of applications from the underlying physical infrastructure introduces node placement flexibilities ($\FP$):
virtual machines can be mapped to arbitrary nodes in the physical network. Moreover, 
network virtualization technology and software-defined networking allows for a flexible selection of data replicas ($\RS$): 
the input to cloud applications, the chunks, are typically stored in a distributed database, in a redundant fashion.
The $\FP$ and $\RS$ flexibilities introduce interesting new opportunities for optimization.   
 
Besides mapping virtual machines ($\FP$) and matching them to their replicas ($\RS$), there are typically two more 
aspects to be taken into account: (1) embedding a minimal virtual cluster network ($\VC$) to interconnect the virtual machines with certain
bandwidth guarantees, (2) while taking into account bandwidth constraints ($\BW$).

More formally, we consider the following problem. We are given a substrate network $H=(V,E)$ (the ``host graph'') consisting of servers $V$
interconnected by links $E$; we assume that $H$ forms a typical fat-tree datacenter.~\cite{todo}
For ease of presentation, we will assume that each server can host one virtual machines. (All our algorithms can easily be generalized to 
a scenario where servers can host multiple virtual machines.)
The substrate stores the application input: we assume that a set of chunks $C$ are distributed over $V$, and that chunks may be redundant,
allowing for replica selection $\RS$. Moreover, the links $E$ can come with bandwidth capacity constraints ($\BW$).

The cloud application is described in the form of a virtual cluster $\VC(n,b)$, connecting $n$ virtual machines at a minimal bandwidth $b$
to a logical switch: a Hose model. Each virtual machine needs to be mapped to exactly one server. Moreover, we assume that for each chunk
assigned to a given virtual machine, we need to allocate bandwidth $b'$.

We seek to optimize the \emph{resource footprint} of the virtual cluster embedding: the amount of network resources which need to be allocated
to connect the chunks to virtual machines (cost $b'$ each) as well as to interconnect the virtual machines (at bandwidth $b$). That is,
the cost function consists of a matching cost $\MatchCost$ and a virtual cluster interconnection cost $\CC$.
and we want to minimize:
$$
\Cost = \MatchCost + \CC
$$
\noindent where $\MatchCost = \sum_{v\in \VC(n,b)} b'\cdot \ell(v,\chunkOf(v))$ and 
$\CC = \sum_{v_1,v_2\in \VC(n,b)} \ell(v_1,v_2)$, where $\chunkOf(v)$ denotes
the chunk to which $v$ is mapped and $\ell$ is the distance
between two locations in the datacenter.

Sometimes, we are only interested in the matching problem or virtual cluster embedding alone,
and will ignore the other cost component.


 

\subsection{Our Contributions}

This paper takes a closer look at the fundamental resource allocation problems 
in virtual network environments, studying and distinguishing between flexibilities in virtual machine placements ($\FP$) and
replica selection ($\RS$), taking into account communication costs ($\CC$) and bandwidth constraints ($\BW$).   

We make the following contributions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We show that the virtual cluster embedding dyn prog and flow
\item We show that the other is matching
\item NP-hardness
\end{enumerate}
