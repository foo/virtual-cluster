\textbf{Abstract.} Virtualized datacenters offer great flexibilities in terms of resource allocation. In particular, by
decoupling applications from the constraints of the underlying physical infrastructure, virtualization
supports an optimized mapping of virtual machines as well as their interconnecting network
% (the so-called \emph{virtual cluster})
to their
physical counterparts: essentially a graph embedding problem.

However, existing algorithms
in the literature often ignore a crucial dimension of the embedding problem, namely \emph{data locality}:
the input to a cloud application such as MapReduce is typically stored in a distributed,
and sometimes redundant, file system. Since moving
data is costly, an embedding algorithm should be data locality aware,
and allocate computational resources close to the data; in case of redundant storage, the algorithm should also optimize the \emph{replica selection}.

This paper initiates the algorithmic study of data locality aware virtual cluster embeddings for
the widely used (fat-)tree like datacenter topologies.
In particular, we
show that
despite the multiple degrees of freedom in terms of embedding and replica selection,
many problems can be
solved efficiently, and we highlight interesting connections
to classic optimization problems. However, we also show the limitations of such optimizations,
by presenting several new NP-hardness results; interestingly,
our hardness proofs even hold in uncapacitated settings.

\section{Introduction}

%Server virtualization has revamped the server business over the last years,
%and has radically changed the way we think about resource allocation:
%today, almost arbitrary computational resources can be allocated on demand.
%Moreover, the virtualization trend now started to spill over to the network:
%batch-processing applications such as MapReduce often generate significant
%network traffic (namely during the so-called shuffle phase)~\cite{amazonbw},
%and in order to avoid interference in the underlying physical network and in order to provide a predictable
%application performance, it is important to provide performance isolation and bandwidth guarantees
%for the virtual network connecting the virtual machines.~\cite{talk-about}

Server and link virtualization introduces interesting resource allocation flexibilities,
in the sense that virtual machines and their interconnecting network,
can in principle be embedded \emph{anywhere} in the datacenter.
The resource allocation flexibilities
can in principle be exploited to improve resource sharing.

A very popular abstraction for for batch-processing applications such as MapReduce is the \emph{virtual cluster}~\cite{oktopus}:
As batch-processing applications often generate significant
network traffic (namely during the so-called \emph{shuffle phase})~\cite{amazonbw},
in order to avoid interference in the underlying physical network and in order to ensure a predictable
application performance,
it is important to provide performance isolation and bandwidth guarantees between virtual machines.~\cite{talk-about}
Accordingly, a virtual cluster not only defines a set of virtual machines offering computational resources,
but also an interconnecting network with (symmetric and pair-wise) bandwidth guarantees: essentially a \emph{virtual network}.

Several algorithms have been proposed over the last years to map virtual machines as close as possible
to each other in the datacenter, which minimizes communication costs.~\cite{oktopus,proteus}
However, existing embedding algorithms ignore the input to the batch-processing applications:
the data. Often, data is stored in a distributed file system, on different servers,
and in order to minimize
communication costs, an embedding algorithm should be \emph{data locality aware},
and allocate (or \emph{embed}) computational resources close to the to be processed data. Moreover, in case of redundant storage (batch processing
applications often provide a 3-fold redundancy), the algorithm should also exploit \emph{replica selection}
flexibilities.

\subsection{Our Contributions}

This paper initiates the study of data-locality and replica aware embedding problems in virtualized datacenters.
In particular, we decompose the optimization problem into different fundamental aspects, such as
replica selection and flexible virtual machine embedding, and answer questions such as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How to efficiently select and assign replicas to virtual machines?

\item How to efficiently embed virtual machines and their inter-connecting network?

\item Can the replica selection and virtual machine embedding be jointly optimized, in polynomial time?
\end{enumerate}

We draw an almost complete picture of the problem space, show that indeed many problems
can be solved optimally in polynomial time, even in the presence of multiple degrees of freedom (in terms of
replica selection and embedding), and
we highlight interesting connections to classic algorithmic
problems such as matching and flow problems.
We also prove limitations in terms of
computational tractability, by showing reductions from 3-D matching
and SAT \maciek{Boolean Satisfiability}; interestingly,
while it is well-known that (unsplittable) multi-commodity flow
problems are NP-hard in capacitated networks, our hardness results also hold in uncapacitated
networks. We also show that NP-hard problems already arise in small-diameter networks (as they are
widely used today~\cite{fattree}),
and even if the number of replicas is bounded by two.


\subsection{Organization}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:model} introduces our formal model in detail.
Algorithms are presented in Section~\ref{sec:poly} and
hardness results are presented in Section~\ref{sec:np}.
After discussing related work in Section~\ref{sec:relwork},
we conclude our work in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
Some technical details as well as additional hardness results
appear in the Appendix.

\section{Model}\label{sec:model}

To get started, let us first introduce our model as well as its constituting parts, formally and theoretically.
For the sake of clarity, we defer the discussion of the practical motivation 
to the end of this section. Figure~\ref{fig:overview} gives an overview of our model.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{figs/overview-fig.pdf}
\caption{Overview: a 9-server (fat-tree) datacenter storing 4 different chunk
types $\{c_1,\ldots,c_4\}$. The chunk replicas need to be selected and assigned to the two
 virtual machines $v_1$ and $v_2$. In addition, the virtual machines are inter-connected among
 each other. The objective of the embedding problem is to minimize the overall bandwidth allocation.}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}


%\textbf{Fundamental Parts.}

\subsection{Fundamental Parts}

Our model consists of three fundamental parts: (1) the substrate network (the servers
and the connecting physical network),
(2) the to be processed input (the data), and
(3) the virtual network (the virtual machines and the logical network connecting the machines to each other
as well as to the data).

\emph{The Substrate Network.} The substrate network (also known as the \emph{host graph}) represents the physical resources:
a set $S$ of $n_S=|S|$ servers interconnected by a network consisting of a set $R$ of servers (or switches)
and a set $E$ of (symmetric) links. Concretely, we assume that the inter-connecting network forms an (arbitrary) tree,
and that the servers are located at the tree leaves.
Each server $s\in S$ can host a certain number
of virtual machines (available server capacity $\capacity(s)$), and each link $e\in E$ has a certain bandwidth
capacity $\capacity(e)$.

\emph{The Input Data.} The to be processed data constitutes the input to the batch-processing application.
The data is stored in a distributed manner; this spatial distribution is given and not subject to optimization.
The input data consists of different \emph{chunk types} $\{\achunk_1, \ldots, \achunk_{\ChunkType}\}$,
where each chunk type $\achunk_i$ can have $r\geq 1$ instances (or replicas) $\{\achunk_{i}^{(1)},\ldots, \achunk_{i}^{(r)}\}$,
 stored at different servers.
Concretely, for each of the $r\cdot k$ replicas $\achunk_{i}^{(j)}$, we will denote by $\pi(\achunk_{i}^{(j)})$ at
which server it is stored \maciek{Do we use $\pi$ anywhere else in paper?}. It is sufficient to process one replica, and we will sometimes refer to this
replica as the \emph{active} (or selected) replica.

\emph{The Virtual Network.} The virtual network consists of a set $\VirtualNodes$ of $n_V=|\VirtualNodes|$ virtual machines or compute
 units, henceforth often simply called \emph{nodes}.
Each node $v \in \VirtualNodes$ can be placed (or, synonymously, \emph{embedded}) on a server; this placement can be subject
to optimization.
Depending on the available capacity $\capacity(s)$ of server $s$, multiple nodes maybe be hosted on $s$.
We will denote the server hosting node $v$ by $\pi(v)$.
Since these virtual machines process the input data, they need to be assigned and connected to the
chunks. Concretely, for each chunk type $\achunk_i$, one replica $\achunk_{i}^{(j)}$ must be processed by exactly one virtual machine $v$;
which replica $\achunk_{i}^{(k)}$ is chosen is subject to optimization.
We will denote by $\mu$ the assignment or ``matching'' of virtual
machines to chunks \maciek{matching is an assignment}.
We will keep the model general, and consider both the case where there are more chunk types
than virtual machines (requiring the assignment of multiple chunks per nodes) and the case
where there are less chunks than virtual machines. (See below for motivations for the different scenarios.)
However, in order to avoid stragglers, we require that each node needs to process the same number of chunks.
Moreover, in order to ensure a predictable performance, both the connection to the chunks
as well as the interconnection between the virtual machines may have to ensure certain
minimal bandwidth guarantees; we will refer to the first type of virtual network as the \emph{(chunk) access
network}, and to the second type of virtual network as the \emph{(shuffle) inter-connect}. The inter-connect 
is modeled as a complete network. Concretely, we assume that an  active chunk
is connected to its node at a minimal bandwidth $\CostTrans$, and a node is connected to any other node
at minimal bandwidth $\CostCom$.

\stefan{TODO: clarify whether there can be multiple chunks and or nodes per server}

%\textbf{Optimization Objective.}

\subsection{Optimization Objective}

Our goal is to develop algorithms which minimize
the \emph{resource footprint}: the overall bandwidth allocation in the datacenter for a given embedding. (Note that
the resource allocation at the servers does not depend on the replica selection or embedding.) That is,
we aim to embed the virtual machines in a locality-aware manner, close to the input data
(the chunks), as well as close to
each other. Let $\dist(v,\achunk)$ denote the distance (in the underlying physical network $\Tree$) between a node $v$ and a
chunk $\achunk$, and let $\dist(v_1,v_2)$ denote the distance between the two nodes $v_1$ and $v_2$.
We define the \emph{footprint} $\Cost(v)$ of a node $v$ as follows:
$$
\Cost(v) = \sum_{\achunk\in \mu(v)} \CostTrans \cdot \dist(v,\achunk) \underbrace{+ \sum_{v' \in \VirtualNodes\setminus\{v\}} \CostCom \cdot \dist(v,v')}_{\text{only for inter-connect}},
$$
\noindent where $\mu(v)$ is the set of chunks assigned to $v$. Our goal is to minimize the overall footprint
$\Cost=\sum_{v\in V} \Cost(v)$.

%\textbf{Problem Decomposition.}

\subsection{Problem Decomposition}

In order to chart the landscape of the tractability and intractability of different
problem variants, we decompose our problem into its fundamental parts, as described in the following.

\emph{Replica Selection ($\RS$).} The first fundamental problem is replica selection:
if the input data is stored redundantly, the algorithm has the freedom to choose a replica
for each chunk type, and assign it to a virtual machine (i.e., \emph{node}). Note that this
selection or ``matching problem'' is non-trivial, even if the locations of the virtual machines
are already given \maciek{it is trivial in locations are not given}. In the following, we will refer to a scenario
with redundant chunks by $\RS$; in the $\RS$-only scenario, the number of chunk types
is less or equal the number of nodes \maciek{the number of chunk types
  is exactly equal to number of nodes; do you refer to idle machines
  for more machines than chunk types?}. Otherwise, we will add the $+\MA$ property discussed next.

\emph{Multiple Assignment ($\MA$).}
If the number of chunk types is larger than the number of virtual machines,
each node needs to be assigned multiple chunks. We will refer to such a scenario by $\MA$.
(Note that in a scenario with only $\MA$ but without $\RS$, chunk types are not redundant.)

\emph{Flexible Placement ($\FP$).} The second fundamental degree of freedom, besides replica selection and assignment,
regards the flexibility in the placement (or synonymously: \emph{embedding}) of virtual machines to physical servers.
We will refer to this aspect by $\FP$. \maciek{Here we would like to
  introduce hosting multiple VMs in one leaf. How do we do that - by
  setting global upper bound on number of VMs per leaf - or by
  per-leaf constant? We also need to update NP-hardness proofs to set
  those numbers to 1 and to modify the dynamic program's base case.}

\emph{Node Interconnect ($\CC$).} We will distinguish between scenarios where bandwidth needs to be reserved
both from each virtual machine to its replica as well as to the other virtual machines
(i.e., $\CostTrans>0$ and $\CostCom>0$), and
 scenarios where only the access network requires bandwidth reservation (i.e., $\CostTrans>0$ and $\CostCom=0$).
 We will refer to the former scenarios
where bandwidth needs to be reserved also for the inter-connect, by $\CC$.

\emph{Bandwidth Capacities ($\BW$).} 
\maciek{We need to introduce several assumptions in model with
  bandwidth. First is that we have bandwidth on each edge that is
  multiplicity of $\CostTrans$. Second is that if we have $\BW$ together with
$\CC$, we need to assume that subtracting $k$ times $\CostCom$ for
arbitrary natural $k$, we still have remaining bandwidth to be
multiplicity of $\CostTrans$. It might be beneficial to introduce
model as: (1) $\CostTrans$ is always $1$ (2) $\CostCom$ is integral
(3) bandwidth on each edge is integral.}
We distinguish between an uncapacitated and a capacitated scenario where the links
of the substrate network come with bandwidth
constraints, and will refer to the bandwidth-constrained version by $\BW$; the capacity of servers
(the number of virtual machines which can be hosted concurrently) is always limited.
Note that capacity constraints introduce infeasible problem instances, where it is impossible to
allocate sufficient resources to satisfy an embedding request; in this case, we will say that the
resource footprint is \emph{infinite}. \maciek{I do not like defining
  value of footprint of infeasible instance. What is the motivation
  for that?}

%\textbf{Remark on Practical Motivation.}

\subsection{Remark on Practical Motivation}\label{ssec:practice}

Our model is motivated by batch-processing applications such as MapReduce.
Such applications use multiple compute units or virtual machines to
process data, initially often redundantly stored in a distributed file system implemented
by multiple servers.~\cite{mapreduce}
The standard datacenter topologies today are (multi-rooted) fat-tree resp.~Clos topologies,~\cite{vl2,fattree}
hierarchical networks  recursively made of sub-trees at each level; this motivates our 
focus on tree-like substrate networks where servers are located at the
tree leaves. In particular, given the amount of multiplexing over the mesh of links
and the availability of multi-path routing protocol, e.g.~ECMP, the redundant
links can be considered as a single aggregate link for bandwidth
reservations. This is consistent with similar assumptions made in
previous work~\cite{oktopus,proteus}.

During execution, batch-processing applications typically cycle through different phases,
most prominently, a mapping phase and a reducing phase; between the two phases,
a shuffling operation is performed, a phase where the results from the mappers
are communicated to the reducers. Since the shuffling phase can constitute a
non-negligible part of the overall runtime~\cite{orchestra},
and since concurrent network transmissions can introduce interference and
performance unpredictability~\cite{amazonbw}, it is important
to provide explicit minimal bandwidth guarantees.~\cite{talk-about}
In particular, our inter-connect (the virtual network connecting the virtual machines)
is motivated by the popular virtual cluster abstraction.~\cite{oktopus,talk-about,proteus}
In this paper, we extend this model with a notion of data-locality.
In particular, we distinguish between the bandwidth needed between replica
and virtual machine ($\CostTrans$) and the bandwidth needed between
two virtual machines ($\CostCom$); in practice, for applications with a large
``mapping ratio'', $\CostCom<\CostTrans$. Finally, note that it is frequently assumed
that the nodes implementing the mapper functionality also implement the reducer functionality,
and vice versa; however, it can also make sense to have more mappers or more reducers for
certain applications.

\section{Polynomial-Time Algorithms}\label{sec:poly}

The problem of embedding virtual machines and their interconnecting network,
as well as the selection and assignment of replicas,
exhibits interesting connections to classic flow (Section~\ref{ssec:flow}) and
matching (Section~\ref{ssec:match}) problems. In this section, we point out and exploit these connections 
to solve a wide range
of problem variants. We also show that a large number of problems
can be solved optimally using dynamic programming (Section~\ref{ssec:dyn}).

\subsection{Flow Algorithms ($\RS+\MA+\CC+\BW$)}\label{ssec:flow}

We first show how to solve
the $\RS+\MA+\CC+\BW$ problem using a flow approach.
Recall that in the $\RS+\MA+\CC+\BW$ problem,
we are given a set of redundant chunks ($\RS$) and a set of virtual machines
(the \emph{nodes})
at fixed locations (no $\FP$). The number of chunk types is larger than the number
of nodes ($\MA$), and each node needs to be connected
to its selected chunks as well as to other nodes ($\CC$), while respecting
capacity constraints ($\BW$).
Our goal is to minimize the resource footprint $\Cost$, consisting
of the bandwidth reservations in the (chunk) access network and the (node) inter-connect.

%We allow an instance to have multiple virtual machines in single leaf.

\textbf{Construction.}

\maciek{We lost $\MA$ in showing degeneration in following section.}
We start by observing that $\RS+\CC+\BW$ boils down to
$\RS+\BW$ in the absence of $\FP$: due to the unique paths
on $\Tree$, the bandwidth allocation for the node interconnect
$\CC$ becomes independent of the replica selection, and can be subtracted
from the available bandwidth capacities beforehand.

\carlo{Source and Sink have been swapped. check for consistency once section is
done (remeber Figure).}

In order to reduce the $\RS+\BW$ problem to a flow problem, we construct
an artificial graph $\Tree^*$, extending the substrate network $\Tree$ and
normalizing bandwidth capacities, as follows. For $\Tree^*$,
we normalize the bandwidth of $\Tree$ to integer multiples of $\CostTrans$,
i.e., for each link $e\in E(\Tree)$, we set its new
capacity in $\Tree^*$ to $\lfloor\capacity(e)/\CostTrans\rfloor$
\maciek{I do not understand the floor here. I strongly suggest setting
$\CostTrans$ to $1$ in the model}. 
After this normalization, we extend the $\Tree$ topology by
introducing an artificial vertex for each chunk type. These artificial
vertices are connected to each leaf in $\Tree$,
connecting the replica of the respective chunk type by a link of capacity $1$. In
addition, we create a
\emph{super-source} $\Source$, and connect it to each of the artificial chunk
type vertices. Moreover, we create an artificial \emph{super-sink} and
connect it to every leaf, connecting to each node by an edge of capacity $\MaFactor$; 
concretely, if $x$ nodes are hosted at the same leaf, we use an available capacity of 
$x \cdot \MaFactor$ \maciek{I think that flow should be from chunks
  towards virtual machines for transporting reference. The reader can
  find the direction unnatural.}.
We additionally assign the following costs to edges of $\Tree^*$:
every edge of the original substrate network costs one unit, and all other edges
cost nothing.

As we will see in the following, the $\RS+\BW$ problem can be solved by computing
a min-cost-max-flow solution on $\Tree^*$, between super-source and super-sink. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/flow_ma_cv}
\caption{Example of flow construction: Problem instance with two virtual machines, four chunk
types, and two replicas per type. The min-cost-max-flow 
is indicated by the dotted lines: each line represents one unit of flow.}
\label{fig:flow_construction}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:flow_construction} shows an example of the extended substrate
network $\Tree^*$: The source $\Source$ is connected to the two leaves, which host the
virtual machines. The artificial nodes are depicted below the leaves, are labeled with
their respective chunk types (e.g., $\achunk_1$), and are connected to the sink
$\Sink$ as well as to the leaves which contain replicas of their chunk type. 
The
maximum flow with minimal costs is indicated by the dashed lines: each line
represents one unit of flow. The dotted lines indicate links which have reduced
capacity due to $\CC$.

\textbf{Algorithm.}
Our algorithm to solve $\RS+\MA+\CC+\BW$ consists of two parts. 
First, we compute a \maciek{an integer} min-cost-max-flow solution on the normalized and extended graph $\Tree^*$. 
This can be done using existing algorithms, such as the successive shortest path algorithm~\cite{successive_shortest_path_complexity}.
Given this solution, we need to reconstruct the replica assignment. 
The assignment can be obtained be decomposing the flow allocated in the
original substrate network. In order to identify a matched chunk-node pair, we 
pick an arbitrary replica which has a non-zero flow assigned to the link directly above it. 
Then we follow an arbitrary path of non-zero flow, until reaching a node.
Having found this matching pair, we remove the flow (i.e., reduce the bandwidth allocation)
along the path by one unit. 
We continue building the assignments by selecting replicas until every chunk type is processed.

\textbf{Analysis.}
The correctness of our approach relies on the fact that
given a graph with integer capacities (in our case $\lfloor\capacity(e)/\CostTrans\rfloor$)
and costs, due to the integer flow theorem~\cite{successive_shortest_path_complexity},
the resulting min-cost-max-flow solution will result in integer flow allocations. The resulting
bandwidth allocations must be decomposable into integer flows between source and destination,
and must be loop-free (given the tree structure of $\Tree$ and its residual flow graph, loops contradict optimality). 
Accordingly, the paths following an optimal flow produce a perfect matching of selected chunk replicas and virtual machine slots.

Concretely, we will show that the path following a flow must always end at a node, and that the
corresponding virtual machine must have at least one available slot.
To see this, let us examine the two cases.
\emph{Case (A):} If the path does not reach the leaf, a contradiction can be derived to the optimality of
the flow allocation. Namely, a cheaper cost (but same max flow) solution can be derived by reducing the flow on this path by $1$.
Since this flow does not connect the source to the sink, the max flow is preserved. 
\emph{Case (B):} If the 
path reaches a leaf, but the leaf does not contain a node but only a chunk replica, or
 contains a node but not sufficient capacity, 
 we can derive a contradiction to the flow optimality by transferring the same amount of flow with smaller cost by removing 
 the flow from the uplink of the leaf. 
 If the path ended in a leaf without virtual machine, there is no connection from the leaf to the sink; 
 and if we ended in a leaf which is already full, we do not benefit from this flow, 
 as no more flow can be transported by an artificial link from the node to the 
 sink. 
 Also recall that the flow is directed, therefore we cannot follow a path 
 from a replica $\achunk_1$ to a replica $\achunk_2$: the 
 outgoing flow from $\achunk_2$ (if selected) is directed upwards.

\maciek{There is one more doubt that the reader might have - do we
  start from every chunk type? Maybe we start from 0 replicas of type
  1 and 2 replicas of type 2 (we can show that by capacity incoming to
  type gadget)? Also, we might not have sufficient
  starting points (but it holds by amount of flow). Those doubts might
  be too trivial, I just pointed out that we do not mention that.} 

In terms of runtime, there exist several polynomial-time algorithms to compute
the integral minimum cost maximum flow on networks with integer capacities.

\stefan{TODO: find the state of the art
I have found some well-performing algorithms here (look at state of the art section):
  \url{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.854/06/scribe/s12-minCostFlowAlg.pdf}; But unlike successive shortest paths algorithm, we do not have guarantees of flow integrality.
Also, algorithm of successive shortest paths can improved a little bit because we do not need to use Bellman-Ford algorithm - we can just use Dijkstra, because we do not have negative costs. This way we can further improve the runtime.
Also, we can upper bound the bandwidth capacity of every edge by total number of slots multiplied squared (squared because there are the same number of chunk types as slots).
}

\textbf{Summary.}
Figure~\ref{fig:venn_flow} summarizes all problem
variants which can be solved with our flow-based approach.

\subsection{Matching Algorithms ($\RS+\MA+\CC$ and $\MA+\CC+\BW$)}\label{ssec:match}

Several problems related to replica selection,
are essentially matching problems. As we will see,
matching algorithms are often very fast, compared
to other approaches such as flow computations.
In the following, we will provide matching solutions to
two different problems: $\RS+\MA+\CC$ and $\MA+\CC+\BW$.

\subsubsection{$\RS+\MA+\CC$}

We start with the $\RS+\MA+\CC$ variant.
Recall that in this problem,
we are given a set of redundant chunks ($\RS$) and a set of virtual machines
at fixed locations. The number of chunk types is larger than the number
of virtual machines ($\MA$), and each virtual machine needs to be connected
to its chunks as well as to other virtual machines ($\CC$).
Our goal is to minimize the resource footprint $\Cost$, consisting
of the bandwidth reservations in the access network and the inter-connect.

We will first observe that in the absence of node placement flexibilities (no $\FP$),
due to the tree structure of the substrate topology $\Tree$, the bandwidth required
for the inter-connect network can be allocated upfront, and does not depend on the replica
selection and assignment. Thus, the $\RS+\MA+\CC$ problem boils down to $\RS+\MA$.

In order to solve $\RS+\MA$, we construct a bipartite graph between the set
$\VirtualNodes$ of virtual machines and
the set of chunks.
Concretely, we clone each node $\MaFactor$ times,
as each node needs to process
$\MaFactor$ replica types, and we collect all copies of a given chunk type in a
single %$\ChunkType$
``super-node''. We connect each node to all chunk types using the
\emph{lowest hop count} to one of the copies as the cost metric (the link weight).

On the resulting graph, we can compute a Minimum Weight
Perfect Bipartite
Matching:
the matching denotes the assignment of chunks to nodes.

\caption{The $\MA+\RS$ problem on the \emph{left} is converted into a

chunks, the
nodes are replicated in the matching representation. The two replicas of each
chunk type are represented by a single node, and all edges connecting to this
node have a weight according to the shorter distance to one of the replicas.
This is visualized for $\achunk_2$.}
\label{fig:matching}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Example.} Let us give a small example.
%
%Figure~\ref{fig:matching_basic} shows an example:
%$\NodeMapping(\VirtualNode_1)$ is four hops
%away from all chunks; in the matching problem, this is
%reflected in the corresponding edge
%weights. Similarly, $\NodeMapping(\VirtualNode_2)$ is
%two hops away from $\achunk_2$, and four hops away from $\achunk_1$. Hence the
%weight of the edge $(\NodeMapping(\VirtualNode_2),\achunk_2)$ is $2$, while the
%weight on the edge to $\achunk_1$ is $4$. The solution to the minimum weight
%perfect bipartite matching contains the edges $(\NodeMapping(\VirtualNode_1),
%\achunk_1)$ and $(\NodeMapping(\VirtualNode_2),
%\achunk_2)$, which is exactly the optimal chunk to node assignment
%$\VmChunkAssignment$,
%visualized using dashed lines in Figure~\ref{fig:matching_basic}.

%\label{fig:matching}
%\end{figure}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:matching} illustrates 
%the procedure for a more complex problem
an instance where two nodes are
cloned into $\MaFactor = 2$ nodes each, resulting in a total of four nodes in
the matching problem. 
The $\RedundancyFactor = 2$ chunks of each chunk type are
aggregated into a single chunk type node $\achunk_j$  in the matching problem;
this gives a total of four chunk type nodes in the matching graph. The costs
on the links between all clones of a specific node and a chunk type are set to
the minimum distance. This can for instance be observed at the edges connecting
the two clones of $\VirtualNode_1$ to $\achunk_2$: both weights are 0.

\textbf{Construction:} 

\textbf{Runtime: Matchings are fast!}
%Let us now study the runtime of the matching approach.



\carlo{Many algorithms solve the minimum weith perfect matching problem on 
bipartite 
graphs. The algorithms runtimes depend on  the number of nodes in the 
graph $n$, the number of edges in the graph $m$, and the largest magnitude of 
an edge weight $N$. An efficient algorithm is described by Gabow et al. in 
\cite{gabow_scaling_algorithm} and provides a runtime of $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/4} 
\cdot m \cdot \log n)$ which translates to $\mathcal{O}((\MaFactor \cdot \Vms 
+ \ChunkTypes)^{3/4} \cdot  \MaFactor \cdot \Vms \cdot \ChunkTypes \cdot 
\log 
(2 \cdot h(\Tree)))$, where $h(T)$ denotes the height of the tree. This is the 
dominant part of the runtime, as the graph on which the matching 
is 
computed, can be constructed in linear time. The distance 
between each node and chunk in the substrate graph, has to be annotated as 
costs on the edges. 
By exploiting the tree structure of the substrage graph, this can be done 
in $\mathcal{O}(\SubstrateNodes)$ for each individual pair, resulting in a 
total runtime of $\mathcal{O}(\SubstrateNodes \cdot \MaFactor \cdot \Vms \cdot 
\ChunkTypes)$ }

The following lemma essentially states that any non-local matching can only have higher
costs in all subtrees. 

\maciek{We need to introduce what we mean by partial matching before
  formulating this lemma.}
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:local}
A local and greedy perfect matching of chunks to nodes is optimal.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Proof by contradiction. Let us assume that there exists an optimal matching $M'$ of cost lower
than the local greedy matching $M$. 
Let us consider the smallest subtree where the (partial) matching of $M$ 
has a different cost than the (partial) matching of $M'$. 
This means 
that a non-local decision was made by $M'$ in this subtree (hoping for savings higher up),
and there must exist two matched pairs in $M'$ that shares a link (one pair is transporting a chunk up, and
 the other one a chunk down). Then we can create a matching $M''$ 
 which uncrosses these edges of $M'$ (i.e., does the local matching on them),
  and is cheaper than $M'$. Contradiction.
\end{proof}




\subsubsection{$\MA+\CC+\BW$}

We can also solve the $\CC+\MA+\BW$ problem variant with our matching approach. 
The algorithm 
essentially uses
the same construction described above for $\CC+\MA$ (but without $\RS$) to 
compute a solution
to minimum weight perfect matching. Afterwards it is verified whether the
resulting bandwidth allocations satisfy capacity constraints. If
no capacities are violated, we found the cheapest assignment. We will
now show, that the problem is infeasible if the resulting assignment
violates capacity constraints of at least one link. 
Before we can prove the infeasibility of the instances, we will 
state the following lemma
which gives us a better understanding of the \emph{locality} of optimal 
assignments.
\carlo{NEW VERSION STARTS HERE:}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:local}
Given an instance of $\MA+\CC$ and an arbitrary subtree, an optimal assignment 
$\VmChunkAssignment$, assigns all chunks in the subtree to nodes in the same 
subtree (subject to the number of avialable nodes in the 
subtree).\stefan{Can this stay this way?} \maciek{Why did we restate
  the local matching lemma (it is worse here)? And why are we rewriting working proof?}
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
\carlo{
By contradiction. Assume an optimal assignment $\VmChunkAssignment$ exists, 
which assigns a chunk $\achunk_i$ to a node $\VirtualNode_i$ outside the 
subtree, although there are sufficient nodes for all chunks in the subtree. 
Then 
at least one node $\VirtualNode_j$ in the subtree has to process a chunk 
$\achunk_k$ located outside the subtree. We construct an alternative 
assignment $\VmChunkAssignment'$, by exachanging the assignments of 
$\achunk_i$ and $\achunk_j$. Since $\achunk_i$ is located in a subtree which 
contains $\VirtualNode_j$ but not $\VirtualNode_i$, and both nodes and chunks 
are only located at leaves, the distance between $\achunk_i$ and it's assigned 
node is smaller in $\VmChunkAssignment'$. For the distance between $\achunk_j$ 
we have to do a case differentiation: if there exists a subtree which 
contains $\achunk_i$, $\achunk_j$ but not $\VirtualNode_i$, the distance 
between $\achunk_i$ and $\VirtualNode_i$ is equal to the distance between 
$\achunk_j$ and $\VirtualNode_i$. Since $\achunk_i$ is closer to 
$\VirtualNode_j$ than $\achunk_j$ the overall costs of $\VmChunkAssignment'$ 
would be lower in this case. If the described subtree does not exists, the 
distance between $\achunk_j$ and the two nodes is the same - which would also 
render $\VmChunkAssignment'$ cheaper than an optimal
solution.}\maciek{This proof only considers complete matchings, but we
need to show that property on partial matchings.}
\end{proof}




\carlo{We also need a node mapping (for both lemmas). Shall we state this here?}

\begin{lemma}
Given a $\CC+\MA$ problem instance and a subtree rooted at vertex $u$ containing $x$
chunks and $y$ nodes, the bandwidth allocation of each optimal assignment
$\VmChunkAssignment$ on the uplink of $u$ is $|x-(y\cdot\MaFactor)|\cdot
\CostTrans$.\label{lemma:uplink}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
From the local lemma (Lemma~\ref{lemma:local}), 
the optimal bandwidth allocation is given by 
a ``local'' assignment, in which all chunks inside the
subtree are assigned to nodes in the subtree and vice-versa. However, the
number of chunks in the subtree may differ from the processing capacities of
the nodes in the subtree. In case there are more chunks in the subtree, each
excess chunk has to be transferred to a different subtree, which will
inflict bandwidth costs of $\CostCom$ on the uplink connecting $u$ with the
remaining parts of $\Tree$. Similarly, if the processing capabilities exceed the amount of
available chunks, chunks from other subtrees will have to be transferred to
nodes in the subtree of $u$, inflicting bandwidth costs of $\CostCom$ each. 
Every solution
which does not provide this ``locality'' cannot be optimal, since a better
solution can be constructed, by exchanging the assignments of one of the chunks
which is transferred inside $u$'s subtree and one chunk which is transferred from
the subtree to a node outside.
\end{proof}

The optimality then follows from the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
Given a minimal cost assignment $\VmChunkAssignment$, 
any solution with bandwidth allocation less
than $\Cost(\VmChunkAssignment,
\SubstrateEdge)$ to any link renders the problem
infeasible.
\label{lemma:no_bandwidth}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Assume there exists a link on which the assignment $\VmChunkAssignment$
  \maciek{This proof is too slippery! Simpler way to proof that surely exists.}
violates the capacity. From Lemma~\ref{lemma:uplink} it is
known that $\VmChunkAssignment$ keeps the assignment ``local''. 
Therefore, the footprint on the uplink of a specific subtree is the number of chunks
(or nodes) which have to be connected to nodes (or chunks) outside the subtree,
times the bandwidth which is necessary to transfer a chunk to a node. There
cannot be an assignment which requires less bandwidth on the link, since all nodes
and chunks have to be used in the assignment and removing the
locality will increase the bandwidth requirements.
\end{proof}
%\begin{lemma}
%An instance of $\Problem$ is infeasible iff. algorithm returns $\infty$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%  ($\rightarrow$)
%
%  ($\leftarrow$)
%  \end{proof}
%
%\maciek{I think that we do not need that lemma, it might be obvious. I leave it
%there just in case.}
%\begin{lemma}
%  If algorithm returns solution $\Sol$ of cost $\neq \infty$, then in $\Sol$ no
%link exceeds its capacity limit.
%  \end{lemma}

\carlo{TODO: change notation of instance of chunk types.}

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width = \columnwidth]{figs/matching_no_rs}
 \caption{An example for the $\RS+\BW$ problem variant: $\achunk_{1_1}$ or $\achunk_{2_1}$ are
located in a subtree with uplink capacity $1$. The bandwidth allocation in the right
subtree depends on which chunk is chosen for processing in the left
subtree.}
 \label{fig:matching_no_rs}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Runtime.} While matching problems can be solved in polynomial 
time~\cite{schrijver_combinatorial_optimization} using
general algorithms, in the following, we show that for our problem
a simple and fast greedy strategy is sufficient.
Accordingly, we can use greedy bottom-up construction of matching.
Its runtime is linear with respect to number of tree vertices. It is more 
efficient that more general methods of
finding perfect matching in general bipartite graphs.

\begin{corollary}
An optimal matching of nodes to chunks can be computed greedily, by 
alternating selecting edges with the lowest cost and removing the chossen 
edge, and all edges connected to the nodes of these edge.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Given an edge with the lowest costs, we can compute the smallest subtree, which 
contains both, the node and the chunk which are connected by the edge. Since we 
know that there is no node in a smaller subtree containing the chunk, we can 
assign the node to the chunk, and according to Lemma~\ref{lemma:local}, the 
resulting assignment will be optimal.
\end{proof}



Finally, let us observe that $\RS+\BW$ cannot be solved using this approach, 
as Lemma~\ref{lemma:uplink} does not
hold for problem instances with $\RS$. Figure~\ref{fig:matching_no_rs}
illustrates this problem: It shows a feasible problem instance in which, due
to bandwidth constraints, only one chunk can be processed locally. If for
instance $\achunk_{1_1}$ is assigned to $\VirtualNode_1$, $\achunk_{2_1}$ cannot
be processed by $\VirtualNode_2$, since this would exceed the bandwidth
capacity. Instead $\achunk_{2_2}$ will be processed by $\VirtualNode_2$. This
requires bandwidth allocations on links, which would not have been utilized,
when $\achunk_{2_1}$ would have been assigned to $\VirtualNode_1$. Hence the
bandwidth utilization on individual links is no longer predictable in $\RS$.
When this problem is transformed into a matching problem, the resulting
assignment will use $\achunk_{1_1}$ and $\achunk_{2_1}$, which violates
bandwidth constraints, although the instance itself is feasible.

\textbf{Summary.}
Figure~\ref{fig:venn_match} summarizes all problem
variants which can be solved with our flow-based approach.

\subsection{Dynamic Programming ($\FP+\CC+\MA+\BW$)}\label{ssec:dyn}

\maciek{In each of previous sections we had an example where we show
  non-triviality of the problem. Here we also have an interesting
  example, which show that placing VMs on chunks can be arbitrarily
  bad. In this example optimal solution places each VM in separate
  subtree and transports every chunk to this subtree. The subtree was
  chosen because it was able to host all the machines, unlike the
  subtries with chunks. The reader might wonder why we considered
  every possible location for a VM and this is exactly the reason}

Dynamic programming solutions are generally useful for problems
exhibiting the \emph{optimal substructure property}, namely, if given
the optimal solutions for subproblems, an optimal solution for the
larger problem can be computed efficiently.
In the following, we show that the $\FP+\CC+\MA+\BW$ problem
exhibits such a structure, and show how to exploit it to
compute efficient embeddings, even in scenarios where multiple chunks
need to be assigned to flexibly placeable nodes.

\textbf{Basic ideas.} For ease of presentation, we will transform the substrate network $\Tree$
into a binary tree, using binarization:
The
strategy we use is to clone every higher-degree node,
iteratively attaching additional clones as right children 
and original children as left descendants. 
%Last child is placed as
%right son of last clone.

As usual in dynamic programs, we define, over the structure of the tree, an inductive formula $f$ for
the minimal cost solution \emph{given} any possible number of virtual
machines embedded in a given subtree. (The actual set does not matter,
due to symmetry arguments.) 
Our approach is to evaluate this function in a bottom-up
manner.  
To finally compute the actual optimal embedding, 
we traverse the computed minimal-cost path backwards.

Concretely, the first argument to function $f$ 
is a subtree (which contains a given set of servers and chunks), 
and the
second argument is the number of virtual machines to be embedded in the subtree.
To calculate $f(T, x)$, the optimum
cost placement of $x$ virtual machines in subtree $T'$, we will
consider every possible split of the $x$ nodes into two positive integer
values: $\ell$ and $r = x - l$. That is, we take the optimal cost 
(given recursively) of placing $\ell$ nodes in
the left subtree $\textsc{Le}(T')$ of $T'$ and $r$ nodes in right subtree $\textsc{Ri}(T')$ of
$T'$. Given each combination, we compute the minimal overall solution for $T'$
for $x$, by taking into account the resulting flow allocation on the edge $e_{1}$ 
leading to the left subtree of $T'$ and 
edge $e_2$ leading to the right subtree, and by
taking into account the capacity constraints on the uplink of $T'$.
This allocation consists of two parts: (1) The node inter-connect
communication is easy to compute, as we know how many
virtual machines are in the left and right subtree, and how many are 
outside. 
%Concretely, for each node pair communicating across subtrees we
%charge $b_2 \cdot (w(e_1) +
%w(e_2))$, for each pair where one is in the subtree and the other outside,
%we charge $b_2 \cdot
%w(e_1)$. Right subtree case is symmetrical. 
(2) The chunk access cost
can be computed by greedily matching nodes to chunks locally (first
inside the subtree, then across subtrees, then outside $T'$).
%In particular, we can
%just consider the absolute value of the difference between the number of chunks and
%the number of nodes in a given subtree, without knowing which
%is bigger, because in our model if there are some virtual machines
%left, we know that some chunks from outside will use the same transfer
%as if we have excessive chunks in the subtree.

%Assume there are $c_{\ell}$ chunks in the left and $c_r$
%chunks in the right subtree. To incline minimal cost we connect chunks in
%given subtree to virtual machines in the same subtree. If we can no
%longer do that, because $v_i < c_i (i \in \{l,r\})$, then we connect
%leftover chunks to virtual machines in second subtree of $T$. If we
%can no longer do that, we connect leftover chunks outside of $T$. This
%strategy is optimal, because connecting any other way can be amended
%(TODO: need better argument here), inclining lower cost. Connections
%inside either left or right subtrees inclines cost $0$ to edges $e_1$
%and $e_2$. Connections between left and right subtree incline cost
%$b_1
%\cdot (w(e_1) + w(e_2))$. Connections from either subtree to outside
%of $T$ inclines either $b_1 \cdot w(e_1)$ or $b_2 \cdot
%w(e_2)$. Finally, we can write down our formula for $f$:


%\maciek{We will want to go through all VM placements, for each of those do greedy matching and choose the cheapest.}%
%
%\maciek{Solution for subtree - how it can look like? It is ``partial matching''. Some matched VMs and chunks, but also some chunks transported out of subtree or some %VMs/slots that will have chunks transported into from outside. So we charge already those incomplete matchings.}

\maciek{TODO: base cases for f that take into consideration hosting
  multiple VMs in one node}

Therefore, we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(T', x) &=& \min_{\ell \in \{0, \ldots, x\}}  f(\textsc{Le}(T'), {\ell}) + f(\textsc{Ri}(T'), x - {\ell}) \\
&&+ \CostTrans(\textsc{Le}(T'),{\ell},\textsc{Ri}(T'),x-l)\\ &&+ \CostCom({\ell},x-{\ell})\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\maciek{We forgot to mention how we deal with bandwidth here. Our
  approach is to check at every placement, at every subtree whether
  uplink edge does not exceed its capacity. If it does for any subtree, we cross out
  this placement. We also need to show correctness of this strategy in
  analysis - but it holds from uplink lemma.}

\end{comment}


\textbf{Analysis.}
The correctness and optimality of our dynamic program 
is due to the decoupling of the costs induced by the tree
structure of $\Tree$ and the inductive substructure
optimality property. 
The substructure optimality follows from the observation that 
in a partial matching (i.e., costs of transporting unmatched
chunks out and intro the tree), 
optimality can be established greedily, and the fact
 that we check each possible node distribution. 
For each substrate vertex ($n_S$ many) we have 
to check the cost of all possible splits, 
resulting in an overall runtime of $O(n_S \cdot (n_V)^2)$.


\textbf{Summary.}

variants which can be solved with our dynamic programming approach.

\subsection{Remark: Simple Problems}

To conclude, for the sake of completeness, we also observe that there are
several problems which
allow for a trivial solution. Concretely, problems with $\FP$
plus any combination of
$\RS$ and $\BW$ (but without $\CC$ or $\MA$) can easily be solved by mapping nodes to chunk locations.

\section{NP-Hardness Results}\label{sec:np}

%\carlo{TODO: Move embedd in surrounding text / move. Figure~\ref{fig:venn_full}
%gives an overview of the problems, which have been solved in polynomial time in
%Section~\ref{sec:poly}. This section will present proofs to show that all
%remaining property combinations (marked in black) are np-hard.}

We have seen that even problems with multiple dimensions of
flexibility can be solved optimally in polynomial time.
This section now points out fundamental
limitations in terms of computational tractability. In particular, we
will show that problems become NP-hard if multiple replicas have to be
assigned to a flexibly placeable node ($\FP+\RS+\MA$ is proved NP-hard in
Section~\ref{ssec:fprsma}), and if inter-connects have to be established
between flexible nodes ($\FP+\RS+\CC$ is proved NP-hard in Section~\ref{ssec:fprscc}); both
results hold even in uncapacitated networks, and even in small-diameter
substrate networks (namely two- or three-level trees~\cite{fattree}).
The hardness of $\FP+\RS+\MA$ and $\FP+\RS+\CC$ imply
the hardness of four additional, more general models, as
summarized in the following figure:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[width = \columnwidth]{figs/np-hierarchy}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Introduction to 3D Perfect Matching}

Both the hardness of $\FP+\RS+\MA$ and $\FP+\RS+\CC$ is shown by a reduction
from the NP-complete problem of \emph{3D Perfect Matching}~\cite{3dmatch},
which
can be seen as a generalization of bipartite matchings to 3-uniform
hypergraphs. We will refer to this problem by $\TDM$, and for completeness,
review it in the following.

$\TDM$ is defined as follows. We are given three finite and disjoint
sets $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ of cardinality $k$, as well as a subset of triples $T\subset
X \times Y \times Z$.  Set $M \subseteq T$ is a 3-dimensional matching
if and only if, for any two distinct triples $t_1=(x_1, y_1, z_1) \in M$
and $t_2=(x_2, y_2, z_2) \in M$, it holds that $x_1\neq x_2$, $y_1\neq
y_2$, and $z_1\neq z_2$. Our goal is to decide if we can construct
a $M \subseteq T$ which is \emph{perfect}, that is, a subset which covers all
elements of $X \times Y \times Z$.

%TODO: image like this: \url{https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/3-dimensional-matching.svg/240px-3-dimensional-matching.svg.png}

\subsection{Multi-Assignments are hard ($\FP+\RS+\MA$)}\label{ssec:fprsma}

Our proof that $\FP+\RS+\MA$ is NP-hard is based on the following main ideas.
We encode an $\TDM$ instance as an $\FP+\RS+\MA$ instance as follows:

 \begin{itemize}
 \item For every element in the universe $X\cup Y\cup
 Z$, we create a chunk type. Intuitively, in $\TDM$,
 each element must be covered, which corresponds to the requirement
 of $\FP+\RS+\MA$,
 that each chunk type is processed.

 \item We will encode each triple as three leaves in
 a substrate tree $\Tree$. The three leaves are close to each
 other in $\Tree$, and the placement of chunk replicas in $\FP+\RS+\MA$
 corresponds to the elements of the
 triples in these leaves.

 \item The node placement will correspond to choice of triples,
 independently in which leaf the node is mapped.
 A node will process the chunk which is located on the same server,
 as well as the chunks in other two leaves of the same gadget.

\item We will use threshold $\Thr$  to ensure that no node
will process
any chunk outside its gadget.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Construction.}
Given an instance $I$ of $\TDM$, we construct an instance $I'$ of
$\FP+\RS+\MA$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Tree Construction:} We create a tree consisting of a root,
and for each triple, we create a gadget which we directly attach as
child of the root. The gadget is of height 2,
and has the following form:
The gadget of each triple $t_i$ consists of an inner node (a router) and three leaves.
\item \emph{Chunks and chunk replicas:} For each element in $X$, $Y$ and $Z$,
 we create a chunk type
($3 \cdot k$ in total). Every gadget
contains three chunk replicas, corresponding to the elements of $t_i$.
\item \emph{Other properties:} We set the number of to-be-embedded nodes to $k$,
$\CostTrans$ to $1$, and the number of slots in each node to $m=3$ \stefan{what
is the number of slots here?}\maciek{it is number of replicas that
each VM can process (the MA property)}. We use a threshold $\Thr=2 \cdot 2
\cdot k$. \maciek{If we update the model to take care of hosting
  multiple VMs in one leaf, we should set this instance to allow only
  one VM per leaf. However, any number of VMs per leaf will be OK for
  this proof.}
\end{itemize}

The construction is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fprsma}.

\textbf{Correctness.}
Given these concepts, we can now show the computational hardness.
\begin{theorem}
$\FP+\RS+\MA$ is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $I$ be an instance of $\TDM$ and let $I'$ be an instance of
$\FP+\RS+\MA$ constructed as described above.
We prove that $I'$ has solution of cost $\leq \Thr$ if ($\Rightarrow$) and only if
($\Leftarrow$)
$I$ has a matching of size $k$.

($\Rightarrow$) Let us take a solution to $\TDM$. We place a node in every
gadget that corresponds to the chosen triples. We match every chunk in a
gadget to a node in this gadget (only the chosen ones). This solution has
cost exactly $\Thr$. As every element of the universe is covered, every
chunk type is processed.

($\Leftarrow$) Let us take a solution to $\FP+\RS+\MA$ of cost $\leq \Thr$. We
choose triples that correspond to gadgets where there are nodes. Since
all chunks are processed, very element of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ is matched. Each
node must processes chunks that correspond to the triple, otherwise the
cost must be larger than $\Thr$ (high costs for the connection between
nodes and chunks).
\end{proof}


\subsection{Inter-connects are hard ($\FP+\RS+\CC$)}\label{ssec:fprscc}

Next, we prove that the joint optimization of node placement and replica selection
is NP-hard if an inter-connect has to be established between virtual machines.
In our terminology, this is the $\FP+\RS+\CC$ problem.

\textbf{Construction.}
Let $I$ be an instance of $\TDM$. We will create an instance $I'$
for $\FP+\RS+\CC$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We will construct the same tree as in previous reduction with
chunk replicas placed in the same way.
\item The communication cost in the inter-connect is set to $\CostCom = 1$.
\item The number of nodes (virtual machines) is $\Vms = 3 \cdot k$.
\item We use a threshold $\Thr =  6 \cdot k + 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot
(k - 1) \cdot k$.  \maciek{If we update the model to take care of hosting
  multiple VMs in one leaf, we should set this instance to allow only
  one VM per leaf. In this proof it also does not matter, as it is
  already forced by infinite transportation cost, however we need to
  define it anyway.
  }
\item We set the access cost $\CostTrans$ to a chunk replica to a high value $W$. This will force
nodes to be collocated with the replica. One example of sufficient
(and polynomial) $W$
is the value of threshold, defined above. \maciek{it is not minimal,
  but clean and sufficient}
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Proof of correctness.}
Intuitively, in order to minimize embedding costs,
nodes should be placed on near-by replicas. We use the following
helper lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:helper}
In every valid solution of $I'$ of cost $\leq \Thr$, each gadget
falls in one of two categories:
$k$ gadgets have exactly
$3$ nodes, and $n-k$ gadgets remain empty.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $W=\infty$, nodes will always be placed
directly on chunks (the access network cost is zero).
Moreover, since
is valid, $3 \cdot k$ nodes are mapped
directly to the different chunk locations.
Now, consider any pair of nodes communicating over the
inter-connect; due to our construction, the communication cost
for each such pair is either
2 hops (if they belong to the same gadget) or 4 hops (if they belong
to different gadgets).
The lemma then follows from the observation that $\Thr$
is chosen such that it is never possible to distribute nodes
among more than $k$ gadgets.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$\FP+\RS+\CC$ is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $I$ be an instance of $\TDM$ and let $I'$ be an instance of
$\FP+\RS+\CC$ constructed as described above.
We prove that $I'$ has solution of cost $\leq \Thr$ if ($\Rightarrow$) and only if
($\Leftarrow$)
$I$ has a solution.

($\Rightarrow$) In order to compute a solution
for $I'$ given a solution for $I$, we proceed as follows.
Given a covering set of triples $S = \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k\}$, we place three nodes in each gadget that
corresponds to every triple of $S$. Chunks are matched to nodes that are located
on the same server.

The solution has the following cost:
(1) the communication cost inside a gadget is $2 \cdot {3 \choose 2}$,
  as every pair contributes two hops;
  (2) the communication cost from each gadget to all other gadgets is $4
  \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot (k - 1) / 2$, where the factor $4$ is
  for the
  communication over $4$ hops, the factor $3$
  corresponds to the number of nodes per gadget, and
  $3 \cdot (k-1)$ is the number of nodes in remote gadgets;
  as we count each pair twice, we need to divide by two in the end.
Summing up over all $k$ gadgets, we get exactly $\Thr$.

($\Leftarrow$) Given a solution for $I'$,
we can exploit Lemma~\ref{lemma:helper} to construct a solution for $I$.
We know that in any solution of cost at most $\Thr$,
$k$ gadgets contain exactly 3 nodes. These gadgets correspond to a valid
3D Perfect Matching: every
chunk was processed and hence every element in the $X \cup Y \cup Z$ is covered.
\end{proof}

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:relwork}

There has recently been much interest in programming models and distributed
system architectures for the processing and analysis of big data (e.g.~\cite{nodb,mapreduce,shark}). The model studied in
this paper is motivated by MapReduce~\cite{mapreduce} like batch-processing applications, also known
from the popular open-source implementation \emph{Apache Hadoop}.
These applications
generate large amounts of network traffic~\cite{orchestra,talk-about,amazonbw},
and over the last years, several systems have been proposed which provide
a provable network performance, also in shared cloud environments, by supporting explicit
relative~\cite{faircloud,elasticswitch,seawall}
or, as in the case of our paper, \emph{absolute}~\cite{oktopus,secondnet,drl,gatekeeper,proteus} bandwidth reservations
between the virtual machines.
In particular, the notion of virtual networks which combine compute and network resources has been introduced.
For a good survey on network virtualization and in particular virtual network embeddings,
we refer the reader to~\cite{boutaba-survey} and~\cite{fischer-survey}.

The most popular virtual network abstraction for batch-processing applications today is the \emph{virtual cluster},
introduced in the Oktopus paper~\cite{oktopus}, and later studied by many others~\cite{talk-about,proteus}.
Several heuristics have been developed to compute ``good'' embeddings of virtual clusters: embeddings
with small footprints (minimal bandwidth reservation costs).~\cite{oktopus,talk-about,proteus}
The virtual network embedding problem has also been studied for more general graph abstractions
(e.g., motivated by wide-area networks).~\cite{infocom2009,ammar,turner,simannealing,ucc12mip,zhu06}

From a theoretical perspective, the virtual network embedding problem can be seen as a generalization
of classic VPN graph embedding problems~\cite{Goyal2008,gupta2001provisioning},
in the sense that in virtual network embedding problems, also the embedding endpoints are flexible and subject to optimization.
In this sense, the virtual network embedding problem can also be seen as a generalization of the
classic NP-hard Minimum Linear Arrangement problem which asks for the
embedding of guest graphs on a simple \emph{line topology} (rather than tree-like topologies as
studied in this paper).~\cite{mla,mla-survey}
There exist several interesting algorithms for the Minimum Linear Arrangement problem,
e.g., providing sublogarithmic approximation ratios~\cite{mla-feige}.

However, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide an algorithmic
study of the virtual cluster embedding problem which takes into account
data locality as well as the possibility to select replicas. As we have shown in this paper,
the resulting problems can be seen as interesting new variants of several classic optimization
problems, such as hitting set and 3-dimensional matching problems~\cite{3SC-hard} as well as flow problems~\cite{korte2002combinatorial}.

\section{Summary and Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper investigated data data locality aware algorithms which exploit two fundamental
degrees of freedom in virtual cluster
embedding problems: replica selection and flexible node placement. In order to
chart the landscape of the problem complexity, we
decomposed the problem into its fundamental aspects,
namely $\RS$, $\MA$, $\FP$, $\CC$, and $\BW$, and studied the computational
tractability of different combinations.

In particular, we have shown that
at the heart of our model lie interesting new variants of classic
optimization problems related to matchings and flows. Interestingly, despite the
different dimensions of flexibility (in terms of replica selection, assignment and embedding),
many problem instances can actually be solved in polynomial time.
On the negative side, we have also shown that there exist computationally hard
problems even in uncapacitated networks. In particular,
we have shown that several embeddings problems are NP-hard already in two- and three-level trees
(a practically relevant result given today's datacenter topologies~\cite{fattree}),
and even if the the number of replicas is bounded by two.

Our results are summarized in
Figure~\ref{fig:summary}.
One interesting takeaway from this figure regards
the question which properties render the problem
NP-hard. For instance, we see that interestingly, $\BW$
does not influence the hardness of any problem variant,
while $\RS$ is crucial for NP-hardness.
$\MA$ only affects hardness if combined with $\RS$.
$\CC$ is trivial without $\FP$, and $\FP$ requires
more sophisticated algorithms when combined with $\CC$ or $\MA$;
in combination with $\RS$ and $\MA$ or $\CC$, $\FP$ renders the
problem NP-hard.

we always suggest the best (simplest and fastest) approach to solve a specific problem variant.}

Our paper draws an almost complete picture of what can and cannot be
computed optimally in our setting, and may be of interest both to the algorithm
and the networking community. At the same time, we understand our model and work
as a first step, and believe that our paper opens several interesting
questions for future research, for instance, regarding randomized 
or approximation algorithms.
