\textbf{Abstract.} Virtualized datacenters offer great flexibilities in terms of resource allocation. In particular, by
decoupling applications from the constraints of the underlying physical infrastructure, virtualization
supports an optimized mapping of virtual machines as well as their interconnecting network
% (the so-called \emph{virtual cluster})
to their
physical counterparts: essentially a graph embedding problem.

However, existing algorithms
in the literature often ignore a crucial dimension of the embedding problem, namely \emph{data locality}:
the input to a cloud application such as MapReduce is typically stored in a distributed,
and sometimes redundant, file system. Since moving
data is costly, an embedding algorithm should be data locality aware,
and allocate computational resources close to the data; in case of redundant storage, the algorithm should also optimize the \emph{replica selection}.

This paper initiates the algorithmic study of data locality aware virtual cluster embeddings for
the widely used (fat-)tree like datacenter topologies.
In particular, we
show that
despite the multiple degrees of freedom in terms of embedding and replica selection,
many problems can be
solved efficiently, and we highlight interesting connections
to classic optimization problems. However, we also show the limitations of such optimizations,
by presenting several new NP-hardness results; interestingly,
our hardness proofs even hold in uncapacitated settings.

we should maybe give the main algorithms a name; we should talk about the case where the number of machines is not a perfect multiple;

\section{Introduction}

%Server virtualization has revamped the server business over the last years,
%and has radically changed the way we think about resource allocation:
%today, almost arbitrary computational resources can be allocated on demand.
%Moreover, the virtualization trend now started to spill over to the network:
%batch-processing applications such as MapReduce often generate significant
%network traffic (namely during the so-called shuffle phase)~\cite{amazonbw},
%and in order to avoid interference in the underlying physical network and in order to provide a predictable
%application performance, it is important to provide performance isolation and bandwidth guarantees
%for the virtual network connecting the virtual machines.~\cite{talk-about}

Server and link virtualization introduces interesting resource allocation flexibilities,
in the sense that virtual machines and their interconnecting network,
can in principle be embedded \emph{anywhere} in the datacenter.
The resource allocation flexibilities
can in principle be exploited to improve resource sharing.

A very popular abstraction for for batch-processing applications such as MapReduce is the \emph{virtual cluster}~\cite{oktopus}:
As batch-processing applications often generate significant
network traffic (namely during the so-called \emph{shuffle phase})~\cite{amazonbw},
in order to avoid interference in the underlying physical network and in order to ensure a predictable
application performance,
it is important to provide performance isolation and bandwidth guarantees between virtual machines.~\cite{talk-about}
Accordingly, a virtual cluster not only defines a set of virtual machines offering computational resources,
but also an interconnecting network with (symmetric and pair-wise) bandwidth guarantees: essentially a \emph{virtual network}.

Several algorithms have been proposed over the last years to map virtual machines as close as possible
to each other in the datacenter, which minimizes communication costs.~\cite{oktopus,proteus}
However, existing embedding algorithms ignore the input to the batch-processing applications:
the data. Often, data is stored in a distributed file system, on different servers,
and in order to minimize
communication costs, an embedding algorithm should be \emph{data locality aware},
and allocate (or \emph{embed}) computational resources close to the to be processed data. Moreover, in case of redundant storage (batch processing
applications often provide a 3-fold redundancy), the algorithm should also exploit \emph{replica selection}
flexibilities.

\subsection{Our Contributions}

This paper initiates the study of data-locality and replica aware embedding problems in virtualized datacenters.
In particular, we decompose the optimization problem into different fundamental aspects, such as
replica selection and flexible virtual machine embedding, and answer questions such as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How to efficiently select and assign replicas to virtual machines?

\item How to efficiently embed virtual machines and their inter-connecting network?

\item Can the replica selection and virtual machine embedding be jointly optimized, in polynomial time?
\end{enumerate}

We draw an almost complete picture of the problem space, show that indeed many problems
can be solved optimally in polynomial time, even in the presence of multiple degrees of freedom (in terms of
replica selection and embedding), and
we highlight interesting connections to classic algorithmic
problems such as matching and flow problems.
We also prove limitations in terms of
computational tractability, by showing reductions from 3-D matching and SAT; interestingly,
while it is well-known that (unsplittable) multi-commodity flow
problems are NP-hard in capacitated networks, our hardness results also hold in uncapacitated
networks. We also show that NP-hard problems already arise in small-diameter networks (as they are
widely used today~\cite{fattree}),
and even if the number of replicas is bounded by two.


\subsection{Organization}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:model} introduces our formal model in detail.
Algorithms are presented in Section~\ref{sec:poly} and
hardness results are presented in Section~\ref{sec:np}.
After discussing related work in Section~\ref{sec:relwork},
we conclude our work in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
Some technical details as well as additional hardness results
appear in the Appendix.

\section{Model}\label{sec:model}

To get started, let us first introduce our model as well as its constituting parts, formally and theoretically.
For the sake of clarity, we defer the discussion of the practical motivation 
to the end of this section. Figure~\ref{fig:overview} gives an overview of our model.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{figs/overview-fig.pdf}
\caption{Overview: a 9-server (fat-tree) datacenter storing 4 different chunk
types $\{c_1,\ldots,c_4\}$. The chunk replicas need to be selected and assigned to the two
 virtual machines $v_1$ and $v_2$. In addition, the virtual machines are inter-connected among
 each other. The objective of the embedding problem is to minimize the overall bandwidth allocation.}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}


%\textbf{Fundamental Parts.}

\subsection{Fundamental Parts}

Our model consists of three fundamental parts: (1) the substrate network (the servers
and the connecting physical network),
(2) the to be processed input (the data), and
(3) the virtual network (the virtual machines and the logical network connecting the machines to each other
as well as to the data).

\emph{The Substrate Network.} The substrate network (also known as the \emph{host graph}) represents the physical resources:
a set $S$ of $n_S=|S|$ servers interconnected by a network consisting of a set $R$ of servers (or switches)
and a set $E$ of (symmetric) links. Concretely, we assume that the inter-connecting network forms an (arbitrary) tree,
and that the servers are located at the tree leaves.
Each server $s\in S$ can host a certain number
of virtual machines (available server capacity $\capacity(s)$), and each link $e\in E$ has a certain bandwidth
capacity $\capacity(e)$.

\emph{The Input Data.} The to be processed data constitutes the input to the batch-processing application.
The data is stored in a distributed manner; this spatial distribution is given and not subject to optimization.
The input data consists of different \emph{chunk types} $\{\achunk_1, \ldots, \achunk_{\ChunkType}\}$,
where each chunk type $\achunk_i$ can have $r\geq 1$ instances (or replicas) $\{\achunk_{i}^{(1)},\ldots, \achunk_{i}^{(r)}\}$,
 stored at different servers.
Concretely, for each of the $r\cdot k$ replicas $\achunk_{i}^{(j)}$, we will denote by $\pi(\achunk_{i}^{(j)})$ at
which server it is stored. It is sufficient to process one replica, and we will sometimes refer to this
replica as the \emph{active} (or selected) replica.

\emph{The Virtual Network.} The virtual network consists of a set $\VirtualNodes$ of $n_V=|\VirtualNodes|$ virtual machines or compute
 units, henceforth often simply called \emph{nodes}.
Each node $v \in \VirtualNodes$ can be placed (or, synonymously, \emph{embedded}) on a server; this placement can be subject
to optimization.
Depending on the available capacity $\capacity(s)$ of server $s$, multiple nodes maybe be hosted on $s$.
We will denote the server hosting node $v$ by $\pi(v)$.
Since these virtual machines process the input data, they need to be assigned and connected to the
chunks. Concretely, for each chunk type $\achunk_i$, one replica $\achunk_{i}^{(j)}$ must be processed by exactly one virtual machine $v$;
which replica $\achunk_{i}^{(k)}$ is chosen is subject to optimization.
We will denote by $\mu$ the assignment or ``matching'' of virtual machines to chunks.
We will keep the model general, and consider both the case where there are more chunk types
than virtual machines (requiring the assignment of multiple chunks per nodes) and the case
where there are less chunks than virtual machines. (See below for motivations for the different scenarios.)
However, in order to avoid stragglers, we require that each node needs to process the same number of chunks.
Moreover, in order to ensure a predictable performance, both the connection to the chunks
as well as the interconnection between the virtual machines may have to ensure certain
minimal bandwidth guarantees; we will refer to the first type of virtual network as the \emph{(chunk) access
network}, and to the second type of virtual network as the \emph{(shuffle) inter-connect}. The inter-connect 
is modeled as a complete network. Concretely, we assume that an  active chunk
is connected to its node at a minimal bandwidth $\CostTrans$, and a node is connected to any other node
at minimal bandwidth $\CostCom$.

%\textbf{Optimization Objective.}

\subsection{Optimization Objective}

Our goal is to develop algorithms which minimize
the \emph{resource footprint}: the overall bandwidth allocation in the datacenter for a given embedding. (Note that
the resource allocation at the servers does not depend on the replica selection or embedding.) That is,
we aim to embed the virtual machines in a locality-aware manner, close to the input data
(the chunks), as well as close to
each other. Let $\dist(v,\achunk)$ denote the distance (in the underlying physical network $\Tree$) between a node $v$ and a
chunk $\achunk$, and let $\dist(v_1,v_2)$ denote the distance between the two nodes $v_1$ and $v_2$.
We define the \emph{footprint} $\Cost(v)$ of a node $v$ as follows:
$$
\Cost(v) = \sum_{\achunk\in \mu(v)} \CostTrans \cdot \dist(v,\achunk) \underbrace{+ \sum_{v' \in \VirtualNodes\setminus\{v\}} \CostCom \cdot \dist(v,v')}_{\text{only for inter-connect}},
$$
\noindent where $\mu(v)$ is the set of chunks assigned to $v$. Our goal is to minimize the overall footprint
$\Cost=\sum_{v\in V} \Cost(v)$.

%\textbf{Problem Decomposition.}

\subsection{Problem Decomposition}

In order to chart the landscape of the tractability and intractability of different
problem variants, we decompose our problem into its fundamental parts, as described in the following.

\emph{Replica Selection ($\RS$).} The first fundamental problem is replica selection:
if the input data is stored redundantly, the algorithm has the freedom to choose a replica
for each chunk type, and assign it to a virtual machine (i.e., \emph{node}). Note that this
selection or ``matching problem'' is non-trivial, even if the locations of the virtual machines
are already given. In the following, we will refer to a scenario
with redundant chunks by $\RS$; in the $\RS$-only scenario, the number of chunk types
is less or equal the number of nodes. Otherwise, we will add the $+\MA$ property discussed next.

\emph{Multiple Assignment ($\MA$).}
If the number of chunk types is larger than the number of virtual machines,
each node needs to be assigned multiple chunks. We will refer to such a scenario by $\MA$.
(Note that in a scenario with only $\MA$ but without $\RS$, chunk types are not redundant.)

\emph{Flexible Placement ($\FP$).} The second fundamental degree of freedom, besides replica selection and assignment,
regards the flexibility in the placement (or synonymously: \emph{embedding}) of virtual machines to physical servers.
We will refer to this aspect by $\FP$.

\emph{Node Interconnect ($\CC$).} We will distinguish between scenarios where bandwidth needs to be reserved
both from each virtual machine to its replica as well as to the other virtual machines
(i.e., $\CostTrans>0$ and $\CostCom>0$), and
 scenarios where only the access network requires bandwidth reservation (i.e., $\CostTrans>0$ and $\CostCom=0$).
 We will refer to the former scenarios
where bandwidth needs to be reserved also for the inter-connect, by $\CC$.

\emph{Bandwidth Capacities ($\BW$).} We distinguish between an uncapacitated and a capacitated scenario where the links
of the substrate network come with bandwidth
constraints, and will refer to the bandwidth-constrained version by $\BW$; the capacity of servers
(the number of virtual machines which can be hosted concurrently) is always limited.
Note that capacity constraints introduce infeasible problem instances, where it is impossible to
allocate sufficient resources to satisfy an embedding request; in this case, we will say that the
resource footprint is \emph{infinite}.

%\textbf{Remark on Practical Motivation.}

\subsection{Remark on Practical Motivation}\label{ssec:practice}

Our model is motivated by batch-processing applications such as MapReduce.
Such applications use multiple compute units or virtual machines to
process data, initially often redundantly stored in a distributed file system implemented
by multiple servers.~\cite{mapreduce}
The standard datacenter topologies today are (multi-rooted) fat-tree resp.~Clos topologies,~\cite{vl2,fattree}
hierarchical networks  recursively made of sub-trees at each level; this motivates our 
focus on tree-like substrate networks where servers are located at the
tree leaves. In particular, given the amount of multiplexing over the mesh of links
and the availability of multi-path routing protocol, e.g.~ECMP, the redundant
links can be considered as a single aggregate link for bandwidth
reservations. This is consistent with similar assumptions made in
previous work~\cite{oktopus,proteus}.

During execution, batch-processing applications typically cycle through different phases,
most prominently, a mapping phase and a reducing phase; between the two phases,
a shuffling operation is performed, a phase where the results from the mappers
are communicated to the reducers. Since the shuffling phase can constitute a
non-negligible part of the overall runtime~\cite{orchestra},
and since concurrent network transmissions can introduce interference and
performance unpredictability~\cite{amazonbw}, it is important
to provide explicit minimal bandwidth guarantees.~\cite{talk-about}
In particular, our inter-connect (the virtual network connecting the virtual machines)
is motivated by the popular virtual cluster abstraction.~\cite{oktopus,talk-about,proteus}
In this paper, we extend this model with a notion of data-locality.
In particular, we distinguish between the bandwidth needed between replica
and virtual machine ($\CostTrans$) and the bandwidth needed between
two virtual machines ($\CostCom$); in practice, for applications with a large
``mapping ratio'', $\CostCom<\CostTrans$. Finally, note that it is frequently assumed
that the nodes implementing the mapper functionality also implement the reducer functionality,
and vice versa; however, it can also make sense to have more mappers or more reducers for
certain applications.

\section{Polynomial-Time Algorithms}\label{sec:poly}

The problem of embedding virtual machines and their interconnecting network,
as well as the selection and assignment of replicas,
exhibits interesting connections to classic flow (Section~\ref{ssec:flow}) and
matching (Section~\ref{ssec:match}) problems. In this section, we point out and exploit these connections 
to solve a wide range
of problem variants. We also show that a large number of problems
can be solved optimally using dynamic programming (Section~\ref{ssec:dyn}).


\subsection{Flow Algorithm ($\RS+\MA+\CC+\BW$)}\label{ssec:flow}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

In the following section, we show how to solve
the $\RS+\MA+\CC+\BW$ problem using a flow approach.
Recall that in the $\RS+\MA+\CC+\BW$ problem,
we are given a set of redundant chunks ($\RS$) and a set of virtual machines
at fixed locations. The number of chunk types is larger than the number
of virtual machines ($\MA$), and each virtual machine needs to be connected
to its chunks as well as to other virtual machines ($\CC$), while respecting
capacity constraints ($\BW$).
Our goal is to minimize the resource footprint $\Cost$, consisting
of the bandwidth reservations in the access network and the inter-connect.

We allow an instance to have multiple virtual machines in single leaf.

We start by showing that $cv$ + $bw$ + $r$ is the same problem as $bw$ + $r$.
The placement of the $\VM s$ is given. The bandwdith function $b$ assigns
each link in the physical substrate $l_i$ a capacity $c_i$. Since the phyiscal
stubstrate is a tree there exists only one path between two nodes, and hence it
is known how much bandwidth has to be allocated on which links, in oder to
satisfy the communication between the $\VM s$. We can therefore construct a
problem with $bw$ + $r$ which has the same solutions, by defining $b'(l)$ as
$b(l) - cv_l$, where $cv_l$ denotes the amount which had to be allocated on the
link $l$ for the communication between the $\VM s$.


\subsubsection{Construction}

\carlo{Source and Sink have been swapped. check for consistency once section is
done (remeber Figure).}

We extend the substrate network $T$ in the following way:
At first we normalize the bandwdith with $\CostTrans$ \carlo{Normalize by or
with? It should contain  $math.floor(\capacity(e)/\CostTrans)$ afterwards}.
Note that the capacity reduction of $\CC$ has to be done prior to this step.
Ongoing we create an artificial vertex for each chunktype. These artificial
vertices are connected to each leaf
containing replica of the respective chunk type by an edge of capacity $1$. In
addition we create a
\emph{super-source} $\Source$, and connect it to each of the artificial chunk
type nodes. Subsequently, we create an artificial \emph{super-sink} and
connect it to every leaf containing a VM by edge of capacity $\MaFactor$; in
case of $x$ VMs hosted at the same leaf, we multiply available capacity of the
edge to $x \cdot \MaFactor$. \carlo{Check model section (multiple VMs per
Host).}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/flow_ma_cv}
\caption{An example construction of a flow problem, with two VMs, four chunk
types and two replicas of each chunk type. The maxmimal flow with minimum costs
is indicated by the dotted lines: each line represents one unit of flow.}
\label{fig:flow_construction}
\end{figure}




We assign cost $1$ to every edge of the substrate network and $0$ to all other
edges. \maciek{Is this still needed? We will refer to the extended graph as
$G$}.
Figure~\ref{fig:flow_construction} shows an example of the extended substrate
network: The source $\Source$ is connected, to the two leaves, which host the
VMs. The artificial nodes are depicted below the leaves, are labled with
their respective chunk types (e.g. $\achunk_1$), and are connected to the sink
$\Sink$ as well as the leaves which contain replicas of their chunk type. The
maximum flow with minimal costs is indicated by the dashed lines: each line
represents one unit of flow. The dotted lines indicate links which have reduced
capacity due to $\CC$.


\subsubsection{Algorithm}

Our algorithm for $\RS+\MA+\CC+\BW$ consists of two parts. First part is to compute min-cost max-flow on extended substrate network. This step is already well-known and there exists multiple algorithms for that. If we only want to know the cost of embedding, this is sufficient.

Second part is matching reconstruction. Specification of our algorithm is to produce valid matching in addition to its cost. We can do that by looking into flow that is assigned to edges at original substrate network. In order to restore a single matched pair, we start by choosing arbitrary replica $ch$ that has non-zero flow assigned to edge directly above it. Then we follow arbitrary path where there is assigned non-zero flow to the path's links. We follow the path until we reach the virtual machine $v$. We output the pair $\lbrace ch, v \rbrace$, remove replica from the tree and decrease number of available slots in $v$. We also decrease flow assigned to each edge on followed path by $1$. We continue building the matching by selecting replicas until every chunk type is processed.

\subsubsection{Algorithm correctness}


\begin{lemma}Integrality of flow
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  All links have integer capacities - we just have to assume it in the model. All links have integer cost - either 0 or 1. From integer flow theorem we know that there exist integer flow and there are multiple algorithms that return such flow. One of the examples is successive shortest paths algorithm.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}When applied to optimal flow, path following never runs into cycles (which means that it terminates).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
There are no cycles in optimal flow because $T$ is a tree and every cycle would have to go back through the same edges both ways, which would contradict optimality of the flow. This remains true in residual flow graph, because no cycles can be introduces by removing paths.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  When applied to optimal flow, path following always ends in virtual machine. Also, this virtual machine has at least one empty slot.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let's consider two cases:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item path does reach the leaf, but it is empty, contains only chunk replica or contains virtual machine that does not have any slots left
    \item path does not reach the leaf
  \end{enumerate}
 Follows directly from flow optimality on extended substrate network.

  (1) We can transfer the same amount of flow with smaller cost by removing flow from uplink of leaf that we ended into. If we ended in leaf without the virtual machine, there is no connection from the leaf to sink; if we ended in leaf which is already full, we do not benefit from this flow as well, as no more flow can be transported by artificial edge from virtual machine to sink (as it can only transfer $vms \cdot ma$). Please note that flow is directed, therefore we cannot follow the path from replica $c_1$ to other replica $c_2$, because outgoing flow from $c_2$ (if selected) is directed upwards.

  (2) We can construct cheaper cost solution by reducing the flow on this path by $1$. We can do that without losing total flow from source to sink, because followed path didn't ended in sink.

 \maciek{This lemma can be proved by flow conservation argument together with no cycle argument. It might be better approach, as I have some doubts with (2).}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}Path following on optimal flow produces perfect matching of selected chunk replicas and virtual machine slots
\end{corollary}

\begin{comment}
Observation. Flow needs to be optimal for this strategy to work, otherwise we can construct such an example that reconstruction fails (because it needs to go back an edge which is disallowed) by following some path. Let's construct binary tree with vertices a,b,c,d. Chunks are in a and d, vms are in b and c. Let's say that we have found suboptimal flow of a->c and d->b. Let's attempt reconstruction. Chunk at a finds VM at b (the closest one). Chunk at d happens to go towards root (it has flow this direction). Then it is forced to go to left child of the root (the last link with flow, and it cannot go back). Then it has no path left, as it cannot go back and path to b is already taken by a.
\end{comment}



\subsubsection{Runtime and memory consumption}

I have found some well-performing algorithms here (look at state of the art section):
  \url{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.854/06/scribe/s12-minCostFlowAlg.pdf}; But unlike successive shortest paths algorithm, we do not have guarantees of flow integrality.

Also, algorithm of successive shortest paths can improved a little bit because we do not need to use Bellman-Ford algorithm - we can just use Dijkstra, because we do not have negative costs. This way we can further improve the runtime.

Also, we can upper bound the bandwidth capacity of every edge by total number of slots multiplied squared (squared because there are the same number of chunk types as slots).


\textbf{A Note on Runtime.} There exist several polynomial-time algorithms to compute
the integral minimum cost maximum flow problem on networks with integer capacities.
One example is the \emph{Successive Shortest Path} algorithm,
whose time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot W((n+m)\log n)
)$ time \cite{successive_shortest_path_complexity}, where $n$ is the number of
nodes in the extended graph (consisting of substrate nodes and chunks),
$m$ is the number of edges in the substrate graph ($|\SubstrateEdges| + \Vms + \RedundancyFactor
\cdot \ChunkTypes$) and $W$ is the highest capacity in the substrate
($\max(\capacity(\SubstrateEdge))~\SubstrateEdge\in\SubstrateEdges$).

\label{fig:venn_flow}
\end{figure}

\carlo{Figure~\ref{fig:venn_flow} shows illustrates which problem
combiantions can be solved by the presented flow-based approach.}

\begin{comment}
\paragraph{FLOW Construction}

This section presents a flow based solution for the variant of the model which
has bandwidth limitations, communicatin between the $\VM s$ and redundant
$\achunk s$.

We start by showing that $cv$ + $bw$ + $r$ is the same problem as $bw$ + $r$.
The placement of the $\VM s$ is given. The bandwdith function $b$ assigns
each link in the physical substrate $l_i$ a capacity $c_i$. Since the phyiscal
stubstrate is a tree there exists only one path between two nodes, and hence it
is known how much bandwidth has to be allocated on which links, in oder to
satisfy the communication between the $\VM s$. We can therefore construct a
problem with $bw$ + $r$ which has the same solutions, by defining $b'(l)$ as
$b(l) - cv_l$, where $cv_l$ denotes the amount which had to be allocated on the
link $l$ for the communication between the $\VM s$.

To construct the flow graph, we start from the physical
substrate. Each edge has a associated costs of $1$ and bandwidth according the
available bandwidth due to the distribution provided by the $b$ function of the
$bw$ property of the model. In addition we create and a node for each
$\ChunkType$. Each of these nodes is connected to every node in the physical
topology, which has a $\achunk$ of the corresponding type. The capacity of these
edges is $1$ and the costs are $0$. In addition we create the source, and
connect it to all nodes, which represent $\ChunkType s$. The capacity of the
edges from the sink is $1$ and it's costs are $0$.
On this flow graph, we now solve the (integer) Max-Flow-Min-Cost Problem.

If the resulting maximal flow $\hat f$ has a value $|\hat f|< |C| = |V_V|$, the
$\Problem$ is infeasible - otherwise we can construct a solution from $\hat f$.
To construct the solution we choose an arbitrary path $p = \{e_1,\dots,
e_n\}$ \carlo{TODO check n}, such that $f(e_i) > 1 ~ \forall i \in
\{1,\dots,n\}$.

\subsection{Matching Algorithms ($\RS+\MA+\CC$ or $\MA+\CC+\BW$)}\label{ssec:match}

Several problems related to replica selection,
are essentially matching problems. As we will see,
matching algorithms are often very fast, compared
to other approaches such as flow computations.

In the following, we show how to solve
the $\RS+\MA+\CC$ problem using a matching approach.
Recall that in the $\RS+\MA+\CC$ problem,
we are given a set of redundant chunks ($\RS$) and a set of virtual machines
at fixed locations. The number of chunk types is larger than the number
of virtual machines ($\MA$), and each virtual machine needs to be connected
to its chunks as well as to other virtual machines ($\CC$).
Our goal is to minimize the resource footprint $\Cost$, consisting
of the bandwidth reservations in the access network and the inter-connect.

We will first only discuss the simpler uncapacitated variant $\RS+\MA+\CC$, and postpone
the discussion of the capacitated extension $\MA+\CC+\BW$ to the end of the
section.
Moreover, we observe that in the absence of node placement flexibilities (no $\FP$),
due to the tree structure of the substrate topology $\Tree$, the bandwidth required
for the inter-connect network can be allocated upfront, and does not depend on the replica
selection and assignment. Thus, the $\RS+\MA+\CC$ problem boils down to $\RS+\MA$.

In order to solve $\RS+\MA$, we construct a bipartite graph between the set
$\VirtualNodes$ of virtual machines and
the set of chunks.
Concretely, we clone each node $\MaFactor$ times,
as each node needs to process
$\MaFactor$ replica types, and we collect all copies of a given chunk type in a
single %$\ChunkType$
``super-node''. We connect each node to all chunk types using the
\emph{lowest hop count} to one of the copies as the cost metric (the link weight).

On the resulting graph, we can compute a Minimum Weight
Perfect Bipartite
Matching:
the matching denotes the assignment of chunks to nodes.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/venn_matching.pdf}
\caption{Property combinations which can be transformed into matching problems.}
\label{fig:venn_matching}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:venn_matching} provides an overview of
which problem combinations can be solved by the presented matching approach.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width = 0.49\columnwidth]{figs/matching_topology_simple}
\hfill
\includegraphics[width =0.4\columnwidth]{figs/matching_basic}
\caption{The problem instance \emph(left) contains two VMs and two chunks. The
optimal solution is indicated by the dashed lines. The corresponding matching
problem \emph{(right)} represenets the same situation. The weights on the edges
are set according to the distance in the substrate. The solution of the minimum
cost perfect matching is depicted by the shaded lines.}
\label{fig:matching_basic}
\end{figure}
\textbf{Example.} Let us give a small example.
Figure~\ref{fig:matching_basic} shows an example:
$\NodeMapping(\VirtualNode_1)$ is four hops
away from all chunks; in the matching problem, this is
reflected in the corresponding edge
weights. Similarly, $\NodeMapping(\VirtualNode_2)$ is
two hops away from $\achunk_2$, and four hops away from $\achunk_1$. Hence the
weight of the edge $(\NodeMapping(\VirtualNode_2),\achunk_2)$ is $2$, while the
weight on the edge to $\achunk_1$ is $4$. The solution to the minimum weight
perfect bipartite matching contains the edges $(\NodeMapping(\VirtualNode_1),
\achunk_1)$ and $(\NodeMapping(\VirtualNode_2),
\achunk_2)$, which is exactly the optimal chunk to node assignment
$\VmChunkAssignment$
which is visualized witht the dashed lines in Figure~\ref{fig:matching_basic}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width = 0.49\columnwidth]{figs/model_ma_r_cv_boxes}
\hfill
\includegraphics[width =0.49\columnwidth]{figs/matching}
\caption{The problem instance with $\MA+\RS$ \emph{(left)} is converted into a
matching problem \emph{(right)}. Since each VM has to process two chunks, the
VMs are replicated in the matching representation. The two replicas of each
chunk type are represented by a single node, and all edges connecting to this
node have a weight according to the shorter distance to one of the replicas.
This is exemplarically visualized for $\achunk_2$.}
\label{fig:matching}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:matching} illustrates the procudure for a more complex problem
instance: The two nodes are
cloned into $\MaFactor = 2$ nodes each, resulting in a total of four nodes in
the matching problem. The $\RedundancyFactor = 2$ chunks of each chunk type are
aggregated into a single chunk type node $\achunk_j$  in the matching problem;
this gives a total of $4$ chunk type nodes in the matching graph. The weight
on the edges between all clones of a specific node and a chunk type are set to
the minimum distance. This can for instance be observed at the edges connecting
the two clones of $\VirtualNode_1$ to $\achunk_2$: both weights are 0.

\textbf{Runtime: Matchings are fast!}
Let us now study the runtime of the matching approach.
While matching problems can be solved in polynomial time~\cite{schrijver_combinatorial_optimization} using
general algorithms, in the following, we show that for our problem
a simple and fast greedy strategy is sufficient.
Accordingly, we can use greedy bottom-up construction of matching.
Its runtime is linear with respect to number of tree vertices. It is more efficient that more general methods of
finding perfect matching in general bipartite graphs.


\begin{lemma}
A local and greedy perfect matching of chunks to nodes is optimal.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Proof by contradiction. Let us assume that there exists matching of cost lower
than cost of $G$. Let's take cheapest such matching and call it $H$.

Let's find smallest subtree $S$ where partial matching of $G$ has different cost than partial matching of $H$. It means that in both left and right subtree we did local matching (do we need this sentence?). It means that non-local decision was made in this subtree (perhaps hoping for savings higher?). Then there exist two such two such matched pairs in $H$ that shares an edge (one pair is transporting chunk up, the second one is transporting chunk down). Then we can create matching $H'$ that uncrosses those edges (does the local matching on them) and is cheaper than $H$. Contradiction.

\maciek{It means basically that in every subtree we can only have more costly solution. Perhaps there exist cleaner way of proving that.}
\end{proof}






\textbf{Adding $\BW$.}

We can also solve $\CC+\MA+\BW$ with our matching approach. The algorithm uses
the same construction described above for $\CC+\MA$ to compute a solution
to minimum weight perfect matching. Afterwards it is verified, that the
resulting bandwidth allocations do not violate any capacity constraints. If
none are violated, we found the cheapest assignment. We will
now show, that the problem is infeasible, if the resulting assignment, which
ignored the bandwdith constraints, exceeds the constraints on at least one
link. Before we can proof the infeasibility of the instances, we will introduce
a lemma, to better understand the \emph{locality} of optimal assignments.

\carlo{We also need a node mapping (for both lemmas). Shall we state this here?}

\begin{lemma}
Given a problem instance without $\RS$ and subtree $\Tree'$, containing $n$
chunks and $m$ VMs, the bandwidth costs of each optimal assignment
$\VmChunkAssignment$ on the uplink of $\Tree'$ are $|n-(m\cdot\MaFactor)|\cdot
\CostTrans$.
\label{lemma:uplink}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The costs result from a ``local'' assignment, in which all chunks inside the
subtree are assigned to VMs in the subtree and vice-versa. However, the
number of chunks in the subtree may differ from the processing capacities of
the VMs in the subtree. In case there are more chunks in the subtree, each
excess chunk has to be transferred to a different subtree, which will
inflict bandwdith costs of$\CostCom$ on the uplink connecting $\Tree'$ with the
remaining parts of $\Tree$. If the processing capabilities exceeed the amout of
avialable chunks, chunks from other subtrees will have to be transferred to
VMs in $\Tree'$ - inflicting bandwdith costs of $\CostCom$. Every solution
which does not provide this ``locality'' cannot be optimal, since a better
solution can be constructed, by exchanging the assignments of one of the chunks
which is transferred to $\Tree'$ and one chunk which is transferred from
$\Tree'$ to a VM outside of $\Tree'$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Given a minimal cost solution assignment $\VmChunkAssignment$ to a problem
instance without $\RS$, any bandwdith function $\capacity$, which assigns less
than $\Cost(\VmChunkAssignment,
\SubstrateEdge)$ bandwidth to any link in the host graph , renders the problem
infeasible.
\label{lemma:no_bandwidth}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume there exists a link on which the assignment $\VmChunkAssignment$
violated the capacity. From Lemma~\ref{lemma:uplink} it is
known, that$\VmChunkAssignment$ keps the assignment ``local''.  As a result of
this, the Footprint on the uplink of a specific subtree is the number of chunks
(or VMs) which have to be connected to VMs (or chunks) outside the subtree
times the bandwdith which is neccessary to transfer a chunk to a VM. There
cannot be an assignment which requires less bandwdith on the link, since all VMs
and chunks have to be used in the assignment and removing the
locality will increase the bandwdith requirements .
\end{proof}
%\begin{lemma}
%An instance of $\Problem$ is infeasible iff. algorithm returns $\infty$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%  ($\rightarrow$)
%
%  ($\leftarrow$)
%  \end{proof}
%
%\maciek{I think that we do not need that lemma, it might be obvious. I leave it
%there just in case.}
%\begin{lemma}
%  If algorithm returns solution $\Sol$ of cost $\neq \infty$, then in $\Sol$ no
%link exceeds its capacity limit.
%  \end{lemma}

\carlo{TODO: change notation of instance of chunk types.}

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width = \columnwidth]{figs/matching_no_rs}
 \caption{An example of $\RS+\BW$. $\achunk_{1_1}$ or $\achunk_{2_1}$ are
located subtree with uplink capacity $1$. The bandwidth allocation in the right
subtree depends on which chunk is chosen for processing in the left
subtree.}
 \label{fig:matching_no_rs}
\end{figure}


$\RS+\BW$ cannot be solved in this way, since Lemma~\ref{lemma:uplink} does not
hold for problem instances with $\RS$. Figure~\ref{fig:matching_no_rs}
illustrates this: It shows a feasible problem instance in which, due
to bandwdith constraints, only one chunk can be processed localy. If for
instance $\achunk_{1_1}$ is assigned to $\VirtualNode_1$, $\achunk_{2_1}$ cannot
be processed by $\VirtualNode_2$, since this would exceed the bandwidth
capacity. Instead $\achunk_{2_2}$ wil be processed by $\VirtualNode_2$. This
requires bandwdith allocations on links, which would not have been utilized,
when $\achunk_{2_1}$ would have been assigned to $\VirtualNode_1$. Hence the
bandwidth utilization on individual links is no longer predictable in $\RS$.
When this problem is transformed into a matching problem, the resulting
assignment will use $\achunk_{1_1}$ and $\achunk_{2_1}$ - which violates
bandwdith constraints, although the instance itself is feasible.

\subsection{Dynamic Programming ($\FP+\CC+\MA+\BW$)}\label{ssec:dyn}

Dynamic programming solutions are generally useful in for problems
exhibiting the \emph{optimal substructure property}, namely, if given
the optimal solutions of subproblems, an optimal solution for the
larger problem can be computed efficiently.
In the following, we show that the $\FP+\CC+\MA+\BW$ problem
exhibits such a structure, and show how to exploit it to
compute efficient embeddings, even in scenarios where multiple chunks
need to be assigned to flexibly placeable nodes.

\textbf{Basic ideas.} For ease of presentation, we will transform the substrate network $\Tree$
into a binary tree, using binarization:
The
strategy we use is to clone every node of degree $\Delta$, $\Delta(v) - 1$ times,
placing subsequent clones as right son of the previous one and placing
subsequent children as left son of the clone. Last child is placed as
right son of last clone.


\maciek{We will want to go through all VM placements, for each of those do greedy matching and choose the cheapest.}

\maciek{Solution for subtree - how it can look like? It is ``partial matching''. Some matched VMs and chunks, but also some chunks transported out of subtree or some VMs/slots that will have chunks transported into from outside. So we charge already those incomplete matchings.}

Let's begin designing our algorithm by writing recursive formula for
minimal cost inclined by placing virtual machines in leaves of a given
tree. Our approach is to evaluate this function using bottom-up
technique using auxilary array, which yields a dynamic programming
solution. To find actual placements of virtual machines in addition to
the cost, we traverse the array backwards, following the path of
minimas.

Keep in mind that number of virtual machines is equal to number of
chunks. However, our function $f$ will be defined by structural
induction on the tree and we will invalidate the property of having
the same number of chunks and virtual machines in a given subtree
(which is true when we look at whole tree).

Let's define $f$ in following way. First argument is a subtree (with
available informations like number of chunks in its leaves), and the
second argument is number of virtual machines that we decided to place
in the subtree (given as first parameter). To calculate optimum
placement of $x$ virtual machines in subtree $T$ ($f(T, x)$) we will
consider every possible split of number $x$ into two positive integer
values: $l$ and $r = x - l$. We will place $l$ virtual machines in
left subtree of $T$ and $r$ virtual machines in right subtree of
$T$. Having such information allow us to compute how much cost we
incline through edge $e_1$ (which connects left subtree of $T$ to root
of $T$) and edge $e_2$ (which connects right subtree of $T$ to root of
$T$). In a given recursive call we charge only those two edges, rest
of edges will be charged is subsequent calls.

Our cost function consists of two factors. First one, communication
cost between virtual machines is easy to compute. We know how many
virtual machines are in left subtree, how many are in right subtree
and how many are in whole tree outside of $T$. For each pair of
virtual machines, first of which is in left subtree and second of
which is in right subtree, we charge $b_2 \cdot (w(e_1) +
w(e_2))$. For each pair of virtual machines, first of which is in left
subtree and second of which is outside $T$, we charge $b_2 \cdot
w(e_1)$. Right subtree case is symmetrical. Second factor of our cost
function is the cost of transferring chunks to virtual machines. Let's
call number of chunks in left subtree as $c_l$ and number of chunks in
right subtree as $c_r$. To incline minimal cost we connect chunks in
given subtree to virtual machines in the same subtree. If we can no
longer do that, because $v_i < c_i (i \in \{l,r\})$, then we connect
leftover chunks to virtual machines in second subtree of $T$. If we
can no longer do that, we connect leftover chunks outside of $T$. This
strategy is optimal, because connecting any other way can be amended
(TODO: need better argument here), inclining lower cost. Connections
inside either left or right subtrees inclines cost $0$ to edges $e_1$
and $e_2$. Connections between left and right subtree incline cost
$b_1
\cdot (w(e_1) + w(e_2))$. Connections from either subtree to outside
of $T$ inclines either $b_1 \cdot w(e_1)$ or $b_2 \cdot
w(e_2)$. Finally, we can write down our formula for $f$:

\begin{multline}
f(T, x) = min_{l \in \{0, \ldots, x\}} \{ f(T_l, l) + f(T_r, x - l) \\
+ TransferCost(T_l,l,T_r,x-l) \\ + ConnectionCost(l,x-l)\}
\end{multline}

One simplifying observation is that to calculate $TransferCost$ we can
just use the absolute value of difference between number of chunks and
number of virtual machines in a given subtree, without knowing which
is bigger, because in our model if there are some virtual machines
left, we know that some chunks from outside will use the same transfer
as if we have excessive chunks in the subtree.

Tell how to go back through the array to reconstruct the actual
placements. Following path of minimas. Other approach is to store pointers to minimas on lower levels as those are chosen.

(Base case) We fill the entire array $Opt_l$ for the leaf $l$ with zeros. It means that we allow hosting $0, 1, \ldots, n$ VMs in this leaf. We can restrict the number of VMs that are hosted in the same leaf by some constant $x$ (that can be independent for every leaf) by setting $Opt_l[x+1] = Opt_l[x+2] = \ldots = Opt_l[n] = \infty$.

\subsection{Algorithm correctness}

\subsubsection{Bandwidth correctness.}

\begin{lemma}
Let's say that we calculated solution for our instance of VC with
ignoring the bandwidth. Then we analyzed every link and it turned out
that some of them exceed their capacity. Then the instance is
infeasible and we cannot fix that by choosing any other matching (even
suboptimal one).
\end{lemma}

It might happen that this lemma does not hold, beware!

\maciek{Below there is emergency lemma in case that above lemma does not hold. In case above lemma is true it implies that below lemma is true.}
\begin{lemma}
An instance of $\Problem$ is infeasible iff. algorithm returns
$\infty$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  ($\rightarrow$)

  ($\leftarrow$) \end{proof}

\maciek{I think that we do not need that lemma, it might be obvious. I leave it there just in case.}
\begin{lemma}
  If algorithm returns solution $\Sol$ of cost $\neq \infty$, then in
  $\Sol$ no link exceeds its capacity limit.  \end{lemma}

\subsubsection{Substructure optimality without bandwidth.}

Definition of partial matching (matching + transporting imbalanced
chunks out of tree and transporting chunk into imbalanced VMs from
outside the tree). Definition of partial matching optimality
(parametrized by number of VMs, subtree and chunks; best among all
possible that match the same chunks and transports the imbalance).
\begin{lemma}

Let's consider an arbitrary tree $T$ with chunks $c_i$ and number of
VMs $v$. Than $f(T, v)$ is cost of optimal partial matching.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Proof by structural induction. First, we take definition of $f$, which
contains values of $f$ for left and right subtree for different number
of VMs (but which sum to $v$). We can assume by induction that those
are optimal. Then we calculate the cost of communication and matching
between left and right subtree (also in $f$'s definition. Then we
choose the minimum cost one. We argue that this one is optimal partial
matching, and we use optimality of greedy matching for that.

Also, we use the uplink lemma to show that choosing optimal partial
matching in left and right subtree does not generate excessive
bandwidth on both uplink edges (we might have doubted that because
optimal partial matchings were restricted to their subtrees and we
might thought that there is some other more costly matching that has
less bandwidth on uplink - to save there).

Also, we use optimality of greedy matching that is in matching
chapter.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Substructure optimality with bandwidth.}
\begin{lemma}
Function $f$ modified to take bandwidth into account returns cost of feasible optimal partial matching (or no feasible solution exists).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

For a given positions of VMs if optimal matching is infeasible, no other (even suboptimal) matching is feasible. Our algorithm checks every possible placement of VMs, so if there would be any feasible placement, our algorithm would have found feasible matching for that (the optimal one).

\end{proof}
\subsection{Running time and memory consumption analysis}

We spend certain amount of time in every of $2|T|$ vertices of binary
tree (factor 2 is inclined there because of binary
transformation). This time can be bound by iterating over splits of
$n$ into two integers, times some constant and we do it for every
possible number of VMs from $0$ to $n$. Therefore, resulting running
time is $O(Nn^2)$.

gives an overview of the problems, which have been solved in polynomial time in
Section~\ref{sec:poly}. This section will present proofs to show that all
remaining property combinations (marked in black) are np-hard.}

We have seen that even problems with multiple dimensions of
flexibility can be solved optimally in polynomial time.
In particular, we presented a dynamic program to
jointly optimize the node placement and (multiple)
chunk assignment, even under capacity
constraints ($\FP+\MA+\CC+\BW$), or an algorithm
to optimize the replica selection and assignment of multiple chunk types ($\RS+\MA+\CC+\BW$).

This section now points out fundamental
limitations in terms of computational tractability. In particular, we
will show that problems become NP-hard if multiple replicas have to be
assigned to a flexibly placeable node ($\FP+\RS+\MA$ is proved NP-hard in
Section~\ref{ssec:fprsma}), and if inter-connects have to be established
between flexible nodes ($\FP+\RS+\CC$ is proved NP-hard in Section~\ref{ssec:fprscc}); both
results hold even in uncapacitated networks, and even in small-diameter
substrate networks (namely two- or three-level trees~\cite{fattree}).
The hardness of $\FP+\RS+\MA$ and $\FP+\RS+\CC$ imply
the hardness of four additional, more general models, as
summarized in the following figure:

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\subsection{Introduction to 3D Perfect Matching}

Both the hardness of $\FP+\RS+\MA$ and $\FP+\RS+\CC$ is shown by a reduction
from the NP-complete problem of \emph{3D Perfect Matching}~\cite{3dmatch},
which
can be seen as a generalization of bipartite matchings to 3-uniform
hypergraphs. We will refer to this problem by $\TDM$, and for completeness,
review it in the following.

$\TDM$ is defined as follows. We are given three finite and disjoint
sets $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ of cardinality $k$, as well as a subset of triples $T\subset
X \times Y \times Z$.  Set $M \subseteq T$ is a 3-dimensional matching
if and only if, for any two distinct triples $(x_1, y_1, z_1) \in M$
and $(x_2, y_2, z_2) \in M$, it holds that $x_1\neq x_2$, $y_1\neq
y_2$, and $z_1\neq z_2$. Our goal is to decide if we can construct
a $M \subseteq T$ which is \emph{perfect}, that is, a subset which covers all
elements of $X \times Y \times Z$.

\subsection{Multi-Assignments are hard ($\FP+\RS+\MA$)}\label{ssec:fprsma}

Our proof that $\FP+\RS+\MA$ is NP-hard is based on the following main ideas.
We encode an $\TDM$ instance as an $\FP+\RS+\MA$ instance as follows:

 \begin{itemize}
 \item For every element in the universe $X\cup Y\cup
 Z$, we create a chunk type. Intuitively, in $\TDM$,
 each element must be covered, which corresponds to the requirement
 of $\FP+\RS+\MA$,
 that each chunk type is processed.

 \item We will encode each triple as three leaves in
 a substrate tree $\Tree$. The three leaves are close to each
 other in $\Tree$, and the placement of chunk replicas in $\FP+\RS+\MA$
 corresponds to the elements of the
 triples in these leaves.

 \item The node placement will correspond to choice of triples,
 independently in which leaf the node is mapped.
 A node will process the chunk which is located on the same server,
 as well as the chunks in other two leaves of the same gadget.

\item We will use threshold cost to ensure that no node
will process
any chunk outside its gadget.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Construction.}
Given an instance $I$ of $\TDM$, we construct an instance $I'$ of
$\FP+\RS+\MA$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Tree Construction:} We create a tree consisting of a root,
and for each triple, we create a gadget which we directly attach as
child of the root. The gadget is of height 2,
and has the following form:
The gadget of each triple $T_i$ consists of an inner node (a router) and three leaves.
\item \emph{Chunks and chunk replicas:} For each element in $X$, $Y$ and $Z$,
 we create a chunk type
($3 \cdot k$ in total). Every gadget
contains three chunk replicas, corresponding to the elements of $T_i$.
\item \emph{Other properties:} We set the number of to-be-embedded nodes to $k$,
$\CostTrans$ to $1$, and the number of slots in each node to $m=3$ \stefan{what
is the number of slots here?}. We use a threshold $\Thr=2 \cdot 2 \cdot k$.
\end{itemize}

The construction is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fprsma}.

\textbf{Correctness.}
Given these concepts, we can now show the computational hardness.
\begin{theorem}
$\FP+\RS+\MA$ is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $I$ be an instance of $\TDM$ and let $I'$ be an instance of
$\FP+\RS+\MA$ constructed as described above.
We prove that $I'$ has solution of cost $\leq \Thr$ if ($\Rightarrow$) and only if
($\Leftarrow$)
$I$ has a matching of size $k$.

($\Rightarrow$) Let us take a solution to $\TDM$. We place a node in every
gadget that corresponds to the chosen triples. We match every chunk in a
gadget to a node in this gadget (only the chosen ones). This solution has
cost exactly $\Thr$. As every element of the universe is covered, every
chunk type is processed.

($\Leftarrow$) Let us take a solution to $\FP+\RS+\MA$ of cost $\leq \Thr$. We
choose triples that correspond to gadgets where there are nodes. Since
all chunks are processed, very element of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ is matched. Each
node must processes chunks that correspond to the triple, otherwise the
cost must be larger than $\Thr$ (high costs for the connection between
nodes and chunks).
\end{proof}


\subsection{Inter-connects are hard ($\FP+\RS+\CC$)}\label{ssec:fprscc}

Next, we prove that the joint optimization of node placement and replica selection
is NP-hard if an inter-connect has to be established between virtual machines.
In our terminology, this is the $\FP+\RS+\CC$ problem.

\textbf{Construction.}
Concretely, let $I$ be an instance of $\TDM$. We will create an instance $I'$
for $\FP+\RS+\CC$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We will construct the same tree as in previous reduction with
chunk replicas placed in the same way.
\item We set the access cost $\CostTrans$ to a chunk replica to a high value $W$. This will force
nodes to be collocated with the replica.
(For now, we can assume that $W=\infty$; a lower and sufficient bound will be given
in the Appendix.)
\item The communication cost in the inter-connect is set to $\CostCom = 1$.
\item The number of nodes (virtual machines) is $\Vms = 3 \cdot k$.
\item We use a threshold $\Thr =  6 \cdot k + 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot
(k - 1) \cdot k$.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Proof of correctness.}
Intuitively, in order to minimize embedding costs,
nodes should be placed on near-by replicas. We use the following
helper lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:helper}
In every valid solution $\Sol$ of $I'$ of cost $\leq \Thr$, each gadget
falls in one of two categories:
$k$ gadgets have exactly
$3$ nodes, and $n-k$ gadgets remain empty.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $W=\infty$, nodes will always be placed
directly on chunks (the access network cost is zero).
Moreover, since
$\Sol$ is valid, $3 \cdot k$ nodes are mapped
directly to the different chunk locations.
Now, consider any pair of nodes communicating over the
inter-connect; due to our construction, the communication cost
for each such pair is either
2 hops (if they belong to the same gadget) or 4 hops (if they belong
to different gadgets).
The lemma then follows from the observation that $\Thr$
is chosen such that it is never possible to distribute nodes
among more than $k$ gadgets.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$\FP+\RS+\CC$ is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $I$ be an instance of $\TDM$ and let $I'$ be an instance of
$\FP+\RS+\CC$ constructed as described above.
We prove that $I'$ has solution of cost $\leq \Thr$ if ($\Rightarrow$) and only if
($\Leftarrow$)
$I$ has a solution.

($\Rightarrow$) In order to compute a solution
for $I'$ given a solution for $I$, we proceed as follows.
Given a covering set of triples $S = \{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_k\}$, we place three nodes in each gadget that
corresponds to every triple of $S$. Chunks are matched to nodes that are located
on the same server.

The solution has the following cost:
(1) the communication cost inside a gadget is $2 \cdot {3 \choose 2}$,
  as every pair contributes two hops;
  (2) the communication cost from each gadget to all other gadgets is $4
  \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot (k - 1) / 2$, where the factor $4$ is
  for the
  communication over $4$ hops, the factor $3$
  corresponds to the number of nodes per gadget, and
  $3 \cdot (k-1)$ is the number of nodes in remote gadgets;
  as we count each pair twice, we need to divide by two in the end.
Summing up over all $k$ gadgets, we get exactly $\Thr$.

($\Leftarrow$) Given a solution for $I'$,
we can exploit Lemma~\ref{lemma:helper} to construct a solution for $I$.
We know that in any solution of cost at most $\Thr$,
$k$ gadgets contain exactly 3 nodes. These gadgets correspond to a valid
3D Perfect Matching: every
chunk was processed and hence every element in the $X \cup Y \cup Z$ is covered.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Remark: Simple Problems}

To conclude, for the sake of completeness, we also observe that there are
several problems which
allow for a trivial solution. Concretely, problems with $\FP$  
plus any combination of
$\RS$ and $\BW$ (but without $\CC$ or $\MA$) can easily be solved by mapping nodes to chunk locations.
Figure~\ref{fig:venn_trivial}
shows a Venn diagram of the trivial property combinations.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:relwork}

There has recently been much interest in programming models and distributed
system architectures for the processing and analysis of big data (e.g.~\cite{nodb,mapreduce,shark}). The model studied in
this paper is motivated by MapReduce~\cite{mapreduce} like batch-processing applications, also known
from the popular open-source implementation \emph{Apache Hadoop}.
These applications
generate large amounts of network traffic~\cite{orchestra,talk-about,amazonbw},
and over the last years, several systems have been proposed which provide
a provable network performance, also in shared cloud environments, by supporting explicit
relative~\cite{faircloud,elasticswitch,seawall}
or, as in the case of our paper, \emph{absolute}~\cite{oktopus,secondnet,drl,gatekeeper,proteus} bandwidth reservations
between the virtual machines.
In particular, the notion of virtual networks which combine compute and network resources has been introduced.
For a good survey on network virtualization and in particular virtual network embeddings,
we refer the reader to~\cite{boutaba-survey} and~\cite{fischer-survey}.

The most popular virtual network abstraction for batch-processing applications today is the \emph{virtual cluster},
introduced in the Oktopus paper~\cite{oktopus}, and later studied by many others~\cite{talk-about,proteus}.
Several heuristics have been developed to compute ``good'' embeddings of virtual clusters: embeddings
with small footprints (minimal bandwidth reservation costs).~\cite{oktopus,talk-about,proteus}
The virtual network embedding problem has also been studied for more general graph abstractions
(e.g., motivated by wide-area networks).~\cite{infocom2009,ammar,turner,simannealing,ucc12mip,zhu06}

From a theoretical perspective, the virtual network embedding problem can be seen as a generalization
of classic VPN graph embedding problems~\cite{Goyal2008,gupta2001provisioning},
in the sense that in virtual network embedding problems, also the embedding endpoints are flexible and subject to optimization.
In this sense, the virtual network embedding problem can also be seen as a generalization of the
classic NP-hard Minimum Linear Arrangement problem which asks for the
embedding of guest graphs on a simple \emph{line topology} (rather than tree-like topologies as
studied in this paper).~\cite{mla,mla-survey}
There exist several interesting algorithms for the Minimum Linear Arrangement problem,
e.g., providing sublogarithmic approximation ratios~\cite{mla-feige}.

However, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide an algorithmic
study of the virtual cluster embedding problem which takes into account
data locality as well as the possibility to select replicas. As we have shown in this paper,
the resulting problems can be seen as interesting new variants of several classic optimization
problems, such as hitting set and 3-dimensional matching problems~\cite{3SC-hard} as well as flow problems~\cite{korte2002combinatorial}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Summary and Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper investigated data data locality aware algorithms which exploit two fundamental
degrees of freedom in virtual cluster
embedding problems: replica selection and flexible node placement. In order to
chart the landscape of the problem complexity, we
decomposed the problem into its fundamental aspects,
namely $\RS$, $\MA$, $\FP$, $\CC$, and $\BW$, and studied the computational
tractability of different combinations.

In particular, we have shown that
at the heart of our model lie interesting new variants of classic
optimization problems related to matchings and flows. Interestingly, despite the
different dimensions of flexibility (in terms of replica selection, assignment and embedding),
many problem instances can actually be solved in polynomial time.
On the negative side, we have also shown that there exist computationally hard
problems even in uncapacitated networks. In particular,
we have shown that several embeddings problems are NP-hard already in two- and three-level trees
(a practically relevant result given today's datacenter topologies~\cite{fattree}),
and even if the the number of replicas is bounded by two.


Our results are summarized in
Figure~\ref{fig:summary}.
One interesting takeaway from this figure regards
the question which properties render the problem
NP-hard. For instance, we see that interestingly, $\BW$
does not influence the hardness of any problem variant,
while $\RS$ is crucial for NP-hardness.
$\MA$ only affects hardness if combined with $\RS$.
$\CC$ is trivial without $\FP$, and $\FP$ requires
more sophisticated algorithms when combined with $\CC$ or $\MA$;
in combination with $\RS$ and $\MA$ or $\CC$, $\FP$ renders the
problem NP-hard.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width = \columnwidth]{figs/summary}
\caption{Summary of results. As this paper only presented algorithms for the most
difficult problems and, respectively, proved NP-hardness of the simplest
problems, several additional results are simple implications (indicated by arrows).}
\label{fig:summary}
\end{figure}

Our paper draws an almost complete picture of what can and cannot be
computed optimally in our setting, and may be of interest both to the algorithm
and the networking community. At the same time, we understand our model and work
as a first step, and believe that our paper opens several interesting
questions for future research, for instance, regarding randomized 
or approximation algorithms.

\section{Two replicas are hard}

In presented model replication is crucial property that makes problems hard. Here we will show that giving minimal replication
possibilities - that is to allow at most 2 replicas of each chunk type - is enough to make problems hard.

\subsection{Idle machines model extension}

We allow spawning more VMs that there are chunk types. Those machines that does not process any chunk still needs to communicate with
other machines.

\subsection{3SAT introduction - NP-completeness of $\CC+\FP+\RS+\BW$}

We prove that $\CC+\RS+\FP+\BW$ is NP-hard by reduction from the Boolean Satisfiability Problem ($\SAT$).
Since $\SAT$ is a decision
problem, we transform $\RS+\FP+\BW$ into a decision problem too, by
introducing a cost threshold $\Thr$.

Let's first recall that the $\SAT$ problem asks whether a positive valuation exists
for a formula $\Formula$ with $\clauses$ clauses and $\variables$ variables.
In the following, we will only focus on $\SAT$ instances of at least four variables;
this problem remains NP-hard.

\textbf{Construction.}
Given any formula $\Formula$ in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) with at least four variables, we produce
a $\RS+\FP+\BW$ instance as follows. First, we construct a substrate tree $\Tree_{\Formula}$, consisting of
a root and separate gadgets for each variable of $\Formula$, each of which
is a child of the root.
The gadget of variable $\variab$ has a root, $\aroot(\variab)$, and two children:
$\positive(\variab)$ and $\negative(\variab)$. Child $\positive(\variab)$ has $\clauses$
many children $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{\clauses}$, and child $\negative(\variab)$ has
$\clauses$ many children $\neg v_1, \neg v_2, \dots, v_{\clauses}$. Every
gadget has the same structure: the same height and the same number of
leaves. By default, we will set the available bandwidth to be the
same everywhere, in every gadget; differences will be shown when we
will place chunks.

We set the number of virtual machines to $\Vms = \clauses \cdot \variables$.
Moreover, we define the inter-connect communication cost to be $1$,
and the access cost to be a sufficiently large constant $W$,
such that nodes must always be collocated with chunks.
(For a concrete value, use $W=$TODO).


We set the following bandwidth capacities in the substrate. There are three
levels of edges in the substrate network $\Tree_{\Formula}$ given by formula
$\Formula$: \emph{top}, \emph{middle} and \emph{bottom}.
We do not consider any capacities at the \emph{bottom} and \emph{middle} levels.
At a top-level edge, we set the bandwidth to $\clauses \cdot (\variables -
\clauses)$.

We set the number of chunks to be equal to the number of clauses, $\ChunkTypes =
\clauses$. To finish our construction, we place data chunks at
leaves, as follows: for the $i$-th clause we
construct as many replicas of chunk $\achunk_i$ as there are literals in the
clause. For each literal $\ell$ (of the form $\variab$ or $\neg \variab$) that satisfies clause $i$ we place
replica of chunk $\achunk_i$ in the leaf labeled $\achunk_{\ell_i}$.

The threshold $\Thr$ is given by the
communication cost among nodes in
a certain solution to our instance. This solution is constructed by embedding
nodes at all leaves of $\positive(\variab)$ and none at leaves
$\negative(\variab)$, for every gadget of variable $\variab$. Please note that $\Thr$
computed in such a way does not contain transportation cost. TODO: calculate
$\Thr$.

\textbf{Proof of correctness of construction.}
With our construction completed, we need to prove that it indeed
decides $\SAT$. We set the capacities such that in every gadget,
at most $\clauses$ nodes can be spawned, where $\clauses$
is the number of clauses of $\Formula$.
We can apply the Bandwidth Lemma (Lemma~\ref{lem:bandwidth-lemma}) as follows:
We interpret $a_i$ as the
number of nodes that are embedded in the $i$-th gadget, $\clauses$
as the number
of clauses and $\variables$ as the number of variables.
The LHS of the inequality of Lemma~\ref{lem:bandwidth-lemma}
is a formula for the communication cost of nodes inside the $i$-th
gadget to nodes outside the gadget. The RHS of the inequality is the
bandwidth constraint for the gadget. This implies that
any feasible solution must embed exactly $\clauses$ nodes in every gadget.


\begin{theorem}
The problem $\RS+\FP+\BW+\CC$ is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We will prove that formula $\Formula$ is satisfiable iff $\RS+\FP+\BW+\CC$ has
a solution of cost $\leq \Thr$.

($\Rightarrow$) Let us take any valuation $\Val$ that satisfies $\Formula$.
We will construct a solution to $\RS+\FP+\BW$ using $\Val$ in the following way.
For each variable $\variab$ in $\Formula$, we embed $\clauses$ many nodes
at the  leaves of the gadget of $\variab$. We need to choose $\clauses$ out of
$2 \cdot \clauses$ leaves to embed nodes. If $\Val(\variab) = 1$, we embed
nodes at the leaves
of $\positive(\variab)$, else we embed all nodes at leaves $\negative(\variab)$.
The solution constructed this way has cost exactly
$\Thr$, because the nodes are evenly split among gadgets, and nodes are not
distributed across $\positive(\variab)$ and $\negative(\variab)$ subtrees.

We calculate the chunk-node matching $\mu$ by assigning every chunk to
the node which is collocated with the first chunk replica. This solution is feasible
(every chunk type is processed),
because the given valuation satisfied $\Phi$.

Now we will show that this solution has cost $\Thr$.
Due to the Bandwidth Lemma (Lemma~\ref{lem:bandwidth-lemma}),
we only have to consider the communication cost.

($\Leftarrow$) Let us take any solution to $\RS+\FP+\BW$ constructed based on $\Formula$ of cost $\leq \Thr$.
We will construct a positive valuation $\Val$ by considering the nodes in
the solution to $\RS+\FP+\BW$.

We make the following observations. In every solution of cost
$\leq \Thr$, every gadget has exactly $\clauses$ many nodes
at its leaves. This is due to the Bandwidth Lemma (Lemma~\ref{lem:bandwidth-lemma}).
Also, inside
every gadget either all nodes are in the $\positive(\variab)$ subtree
of variable $\variab$, or in the $\negative(\variab)$ subtree. This is true
because the cost of a solution where at least one gadget has nodes
distributed across subtrees is
always greater than $\Thr$.

TODO Maciek: prove it more formally. First, define semi-feasible solution. Let's take any $p,q$ being the number of nodes
spawned in left and right subtree. Then we say that we can improve the
solution by moving all $q$ to where $p$s lie and we have cheaper solution.

Now we can construct our valuation $\Val$, as follows
(for each variable $\variab$ in $\Formula$):
If $v_1$ hosts a node then $\Val(\variab) = \top$,
otherwise $\Val(\variab) = \bot$.

The valuation $\Val$ satisfies all clauses, and hence $\Formula$,
as the solution to $\RS+\FP+\BW$ covers all chunks. To see this,
consider the leaf handling any given clause chunk;
it is a witness that the corresponding clause is true.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Two replicas are hard ($\RS(2)+\FP+\CC+\BW$)}\label{ssec:two}

Our results so far indicate that dealing with replication can be challenging.
However, all our hardness proofs concerned scenarios with three replicas,
which raises the question whether the problems can be solved in polynomial time
with a replication factor of two only. (Similarly to, say, the $\ZSAT$ problem
which is tractable in contrast to $\TSAT$.)

In the following, we show that this is not the case: the problem remains
NP-hard, at least in the capacitated network.

The proof is by reduction from $\TSAT$. Given a formula $\Formula$ in
conjunctive normal form, consisting of $\clauses$ clauses and $\vars$ variables, we construct a problem instance and substrate tree
$T_{\Formula}$ using two types of gadgets: gadgets for variables and
gadgets for clauses. \emph{Nota bene:}
unlike in the previous proofs, for every clause we will create three chunk types instead of just one.

\textbf{Construction.}
We distribute chunks among servers as follows. First,
similarly to the previous proofs with three replicas, we put clause chunks in
variable gadgets; however, now we place distinct chunks instead of
three copies of the same chunk. Second, we place three chunks that
correspond to clauses in all three leaves of their clause gadgets.
Thus, in total, $6 \cdot \clauses$ variable chunks are mapped.
We will consider a setting where $\clauses \cdot \vars + 2\clauses$ nodes need to be mapped. Our intention is that in
every variable gadget, there will be $\clauses$ nodes,
 and in every clause
gadgets there will be two nodes.

The available bandwidth of the top edge of the gadget of each variable $\variab$ is set to
$\capa(v) = 3  \cdot  3  \cdot  (3  \cdot  (\vars - 1) + 2  \cdot  \clauses) $.
The first factor is the tree distance which is 6 divided by 2 (as
we count each pair twice). The second factor is
the number of nodes to be placed in every variable gadget.
So the first term of the
sum is three times the number of outer variable gadgets,
and the second term is the
number of nodes in each of the $\clauses$ clause gadgets.

The available bandwidth for the top edge of each clause gadget is set to
$\capa(\clauses) = 3  \cdot  2  \cdot  (2  \cdot  (\clauses - 1) + 3  \cdot  \vars) $.

\stefan{TODO Carlo: The construction is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:two}.}


\textbf{Proof of correctness.}

We first prove the following helper lemma.
\begin{lemma}
Every valid solution to $\FP+\RS(2)+\BW+\CC$
with cost at most $\Thr$ has the property that
there are exactly $\clauses$ nodes in each of the $\vars$ variable gadgets
and exactly two nodes in each of the $\clauses$ clause gadgets.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The claim is due to the bandwidth constraints. We have to take into
consideration the following communication paths:
communication to clause gadgets and
communication to
other variable gadgets.
In every valid solution of cost at most $\Thr$ we have exactly
$\clauses$ nodes in each variable gadget and two nodes in each clause gadget.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$\FP+\RS(2)+\BW+\CC$ is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We show that $\FP+\RS(2)+\BW+\CC$ has a solution of cost $\leq
  \Thr$ if and only if $\Formula\in \TSAT$ is satisfiable.

($\Rightarrow$) If we have a positive valuation of $\Formula$, we fill variable gadgets with nodes like in
the proofs before. Then we fill $2 \cdot \clauses$ nodes as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the first literal satisfies the clause, we map two nodes in the second and
third leaf of the corresponding clause gadget.
\item If the first literal does not satisfy the clause, we map two nodes to the first
and second leaf of the clause gadget.
\end{itemize}

TODO: chunk assignment should be based on valuation!

We then assign chunks to nodes as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Chunk $\achunk_i^1$ is matched to the node which is located in a variable gadget; there
must be one, as the valuation satisfies the formula.
\item Chunks $\achunk_i^2$ and $\achunk_i^3$ are matched to nodes which are
located in clause
gadgets; there exist corresponding minimal-cost solutions.
\end{itemize}

Thus, we have produced a feasible solution of cost $\Thr$, as there are no
access and inter-connect costs.

($\Leftarrow$)
Let us take any solution $\Sol$ to $\RS(2)+\FP+\BW$ of cost $\leq \Thr$.
Then we can compute a positive valuation by setting each variable $\variab$
as follows:
$\Val(\variab)= \top$ iff there is a node at the first leaf on the positive side of the $\variab$ gadget in $\Sol$,
and $\Val(\variab)=\bot$ otherwise.

%$\Val(\variab)$ =
%\begin{cases}
%\top & \mbox{iff there lies VM on first leaf on positive side of $\variab$ gadget in $\Sol$}\\
%\bot & \mbox{otherwise}
%\end{cases}

The theorem now follows from the following two additional lemmas.
\begin{lemma}
For every clause there exists a node in a variable gadget that processes one of
  three chunks that correspond to that clause.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 Each of the three chunks that correspond to every clause,
 is assigned a collocated node.
 At least one of those three nodes is not idle in a variable gadget;
otherwise, those two VMs in clause gadgets would not suffice in
satisfying all chunk types.
\end{proof}

Observation. It might happen that in $\Sol$, two nodes in
clause variables are idle, and three nodes in variable gadgets are
processing those $3$ chunk types. In this case, we
arbitrary nodes can be taken in the rest
of the proof.

\begin{lemma}
$\Val$ satisfies $\Formula$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let us consider the matching $M$ of $\Sol$, and let us consider an arbitrary clause of
$\Formula$ as well as its $3$ chunk types: $\achunk_i^1, \achunk_i^2, \achunk_i^3$.
We will refer to the nodes corresponding to them
by $v_i^1, v_i^2, v_i^3$; two of them lie in clause gadgets.
Take the chunk type that was processed in variable
gadgets and look at where it was processed.
In our valuation $\Val$, we set the literal of the node leaf to
$\top$; therefore the clause is satisfied.
\end{proof}
\end{proof}

\subsection{SAT bandwidth lemma proof}
The following lemma is useful in our NP-hardness proofs.

\begin{lemma}[Bandwidth Lemma]\label{lem:bandwidth-lemma}
  Let $\clauses$ and $\variables > 4$ be two arbitrary positive integers. Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots,
  a_{\variables}$ be a sequence of $\variables$ integers which adds up to $\clauses \cdot \variables$. Also, for
  each $i$ we have $a_i \leq 2 \cdot \clauses$. Then it holds that if
  $$ \forall_i:~~ a_i \cdot (\clauses \cdot \variables - a_i) \leq \clauses \cdot (\clauses \cdot \variables -
  \clauses), $$
\noindent  then for each $i$: $a_i = \clauses$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For the sake of contradiction, let us assume that there exists an index $k$ such that
$a_k \neq \clauses$. Then we can distinguish between two cases:
either $a_k<\clauses$ or
$a_k>\clauses$.

\textbf{Case $a_k<\clauses$:} If there exists a $k$ with $a_k<\clauses$,
due to the fact that the sequence adds up to $\clauses \cdot \variables$,
there must also exist a $k'$ such that $a_{k'}<\clauses$ (by a simple
pigeon hole principle). Thus, this case can
also be reduced to the second case (\textbf{Case $a_k>\clauses$}) proved
next.

\textbf{Case $a_k>\clauses$:} Since it also holds that $a_k < 2\clauses$,
$a_k$ must be of the form $\clauses + x$ for $x \in [1, \ldots, \clauses]$.
Let us consider the (bandwidth) inequality:
$$ (\clauses + x) \cdot (\clauses \cdot \variables - \clauses - x) \leq \clauses \cdot (\clauses \cdot \variables - x) $$

This can be transformed to:

$$ 0 \leq x(x - (\clauses \cdot (\variables - 2))) $$

The equation holds for $x \leq 0$ or $x \geq \clauses \cdot (\variables - 2)$,
and no
positive $x \leq \clauses$ can satisfy this inequality for $\variables > 4$. Contradiction.
\end{proof}
