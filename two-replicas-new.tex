We have seen that replica selection flexibilities can render embeddings computationally hard.
We will now provide a more detailed look at this hardness result
and explore the minimal requirements for rendering replica selection hard.
In particular, we will show that already two replicas for each chunk type are sufficient to
introduce intractability.

Namely, we provide the NP-hardness results for two restricted variants of Virtual Cluster Embedding (Sections~\ref{ap:tworep-ma} and \ref{ap:tworep-ni}).
We augment the $\RS$ variant of $\VCEMB$ problem in the following way: by $\RS(k)$ we denote the problem where each chunk has the redundancy factor at most $k$.
In Section~\ref{ap:tworep-ma} we provide the hardness result for $\RS(2)+\MA+\FP$, and in Section~\ref{ap:tworep-ni} we provide the hardness result for $\RS(2)+\FP+\CC+\BW$.

Both problems are reduced from the problem $\TDPM$ (see Section~\ref{sec:3dm_intro} with no further restrictions.
The constructions are based upon the reduction of $\TDPM$ to $\FP+\RS+\MA$ (see Section~\ref{ssec:fprsma}) and the reduction of $\TDPM$ to $\FP+\RS+\CC$ (see Section~\ref{ssec:fprscc}).
However, in contrast to Section~\ref{ssec:fprscc}, in two replica variant without multiple assignment, we added the bandwidth constraints.
It is currently unknown to the authors of this very paper, whether the hardness result holds without bandwidth constraints (namely, whether the problem $\RS(2)+\FP+\CC$ is NP-hard).
The necessity for bandwidth constraints arises as to deal with restricted factor of replication, we need to introduce gadgets in the tree that makes the tree asymmetric.
Introducing bandwidth constraints allows to control the number of nodes spawning in certain parts of the tree.

\subsection{Two Replicas without Bandwidth Constraints}\label{ap:tworep-ma}

We now show that the 2-replica selection problem is even NP-hard
without capacity constraints.  In particular, we consider the problem
variant~$\RS(2)+\MA(4)+\FP$ with at most two replicas of each chunk type and assignment factor
four. There are no capacity constraints on links.

Our construction consists of two major modifications to hardness result without replication factor restrictions (for that result, refer to Section~\ref{ssec:fprsma}.

First, we provide the tools for restricting the placement of nodes in certain parts of the tree.
In Section~\ref{ssec:fprsma}, due to symmetric structure of the tree, the carefully crafted threshold value allowed us to proof that e.g. no Triple Gadget ever had two or more nodes placed in it.
We still use the threshold value as the placement mechanism, but in this section, due to asymmetrical tree construction, we cope it with the concept of unique chunks on the comb (by the \emph{comb} we denote the balanced tree, where all non-root vertices has at most one child).
